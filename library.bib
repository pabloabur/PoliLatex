Recent technological advances have made it possible to identify the concurrent activity of several tens of motor units, in contrast with much smaller samples available in classic studies. We discuss how these advances in technology have enabled the development of a population perspective of how the central nervous system controls motor unit activity and thereby the forces exerted by muscles.},

abstract = {Dendrites contain voltage-sensitive conductances that, in vivo, can be influenced by neuromodulatory inputs. In spinal motoneurons, dendrites have voltage-activated persistent inward currents that are facilitated by neuromodulatory input from monoaminergic axons originating in the brainstem. The highest levels of monoamine input are likely to occur during 'fight or flight' behavioral situations. At these high levels, the persistent currents are so large that the dendrites of motoneurons become hyperexcitable, enhancing ionotropic inputs by fivefold or more and allowing the firing rates required for maximal activation of muscle fibers to be generated by surprisingly small inputs. Moderate dendritic excitability (twofold to threefold enhancement) is likely to be a standard component of many normal motor behaviors, such as locomotion. Thus, during normal motor behavior, synaptic integration might be dominated by active currents intrinsic to the dendritic tree rather than by the synaptic current entering via ionotropic channels.},

abstract = {Reflex responses of tibialis anterior motor units to stretch stimuli were investigated in human subjects. Three types of stretch stimuli were applied (tap-like, ramp-and-hold, and half-sine stretch). Stimulus-induced responses in single motor units were analyzed using the classical technique, which involved building average surface electromyogram (SEMG) and peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) from the discharge times of motor units and peristimulus frequencygrams (PSF) from the instantaneous discharge rates of single motor units. With the use of SEMG and PSTH, the tap-like stretch stimulus induced five separate reflex responses, on average. With the same single motor unit data, the PSF technique indicated that the tap stimulus induced only three reflex responses. Similar to the finding using the tap-like stretch stimuli, ramp-and-hold stimuli induced several peaks and troughs in the SEMG and PSTH. The PSF analyses displayed genuine increases in discharge rates underlying the peaks but not underlying the troughs. Half-sine stretch stimuli induced a long-lasting excitation followed by a long-lasting silent period in SEMG and PSTH. The increase in the discharge rate, however, lasted for the entire duration of the stimulus and continued during the silent period. The results are discussed in the light of the fact that the discharge rate of a motoneuron has a strong positive linear association with the effective synaptic current it receives and hence represents changes in the membrane potential more directly and accurately than the other indirect measures. This study suggests that the neuronal pathway of the human stretch reflex does not include inhibitory pathways.},

@article{Stashuk1993,
abstract = {A technique for simulating electromyographic (EMG) signals is reported. The four step method is physiologically based and begins with the modelling of a cross-section of a muscle. Within this cross-section motor unit territories of various sizes are randomly distributed and within a detection area at the centre of the cross-section individual muscle fibres are modelled and randomly assigned to appropriate motor units. For the motor units with fibres in the detection area, recruitment and firing time behaviours, as a function of an assumed level of contraction, are then simulated. For each active motor unit with fibres in the detection area, motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) are created using a line source volume conductor model. MUAPs can be created for various types of detecting electrodes including concentric and monopolar needle electrodes. Finally, the individual motor unit firing time behaviours and MUAPs are combined to create a complete EMG signal. The routines are interfaced through a series of user-friendly menus and forms, are implemented in C and can be run on any IBM compatible machine. Exemplary data are presented along with results from attempts to evaluate the model. Suggested uses of the simulation package, especially with respect to EMG signal decomposition, are discussed.},

abstract = {The correspondence between afferent discharges and sinusoidal length modulations (0.2--10 cps, under 10{\%} of the natural length variations) was studied in isolated fast-adapting stretch receptor organs (FAO) of crayfish, largely using average displays of rate vs. length (or derivatives) along the cycle. Rate modulations were greatest during early cycles and then stabilized, an initial adjustment remindful of mechanical preconditioning. Responses to stimulation in the FAO, as in the slowly-adapting organs (SAO) and possibly other receptors, exhibit the following features, all striking because of their magnitude and ubiquity. i) A zig-zag overall afferent rate vs. stimulus frequency graph with positively and negatively sloped segments. This precludes the straightforward use of Bode plots. ii) Marked non-linearities as an obvious stimulus-response locking in the positively sloped segments, a double-valuedness with one rate while stretching and another while shortening, a lower-limit saturation with the receptor silent for more than half a cycle, and an asymmetric rate sensitivity. iii) Clear-cut discharge leads relative to the stimulus at low frequencies and lags at high ones. The FAO responds worse than the SAO to low frequencies, and better to high ones; it is locked 1-to-1 in a much broader range (e.g., 3--100 vs. 1--3 cps). All features were strongly frequency-dependent. With higher frequencies: i) the number of impulses per cycle fell from several to just one and finally to one every several cycles at higher values; ii) the two values of each length approached one another usually but not always; iii) the silent proportion of the cycle increased; and iv) the rate sensitivity changed. Each feature can arise in principle at any of the transduction stages from length to discharge: the mechanical transduction from length to dendritic deformation, an the encoder one from generator potentials to discharges are particularly likely candidates.},

@article{Duysens2008,
abstract = {Through recent studies, the role of proprioceptors in reactions to perturbations during gait has been finally somewhat better understood. The input from spindle afferents has been investigated with tendon taps, vibration and other forms of muscle stretches, including some resembling natural perturbations (stumbling, slips, and ankle inversions). It was found that activation of spindle afferents produces short-latency response (SLR), consistent with a fast spinal pathway. These reflexes induce relatively minor activation in the stretched muscles. A central question is whether stretch reflexes can occur for stimuli that are quite remote. Thus, a new study was made to examine whether foot sole vibration is able to elicit re. ex responses in upper-leg muscles, for example by conduction of vibrations throughout the whole leg. SLR responses were indeed found not only in lower-but also in upper-leg muscles. Similarly during stumbling, SLR are observed throughout the whole limb, although the primary perturbation occurs at foot level. After the SLR, much stronger activations usually occur, with latencies (85 or 120 ms) well below those seen in voluntary contractions. These late responses are much more selective and presumably linked to the maintenance of stability. The role of the I-b afferents from the Golgi tendon organs (GTO) is less clear. From animal work, it is known that these afferents are very sensitive to active muscle contraction and that they play a role in providing reinforcing feedback to extensors during the stance phase. The available evidence supports this notion in humans but lack of selective activation methods precludes more conclusive confirmation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mechanical stiffness (vertical, leg and joint stiffness) can be calculated during normal human movements, such as running and hopping. Mechanical stiffness is thought to influence several athletic variables, including rate of force development, elastic energy storage and utilization and sprint kinematics. Consequently, the relationship between mechanical stiffness and athletic performance is of great interest to the sport and research communities. Unfortunately, these relationships are relatively unexplored by researchers. For example, there are no longitudinal studies that have investigated the effects of strength or power training on mechanical stiffness levels (calculated during human running). In addition to reviewing the available literature on the relationships between mechanical stiffness (calculated during human running) and functional performance, this review focuses its discussion on the various equipment and methods used to calculate leg-spring stiffness during human running. Furthermore, future implications are presented for practitioners and researchers based on both the limitations and the gaps in the literature reviewed. It is our hope that a better understanding of mechanical stiffness will aid in improving the methodological quality of research in this area and its subsequent effect on athletic performance.},

abstract = {Humans routinely make movements to targets that have different accuracy requirements in different directions. Examples extend from everyday occurrences such as grasping the handle of a coffee cup to the more refined instance of a surgeon positioning a scalpel. The attainment of accuracy in situations such as these might be related to the nervous system's capacity to regulate the limb's resistance to displacement, or impedance. To test this idea, subjects made movements from random starting locations to targets that had shape-dependent accuracy requirements. We used a robotic device to assess both limb impedance and patterns of movement variability just as the subject reached the target. We show that impedance increases in directions where required accuracy is high. Independent of target shape, patterns of limb stiffness are seen to predict spatial patterns of movement variability. The nervous system is thus seen to modulate limb impedance in entirely predictable environments to aid in the attainment of reaching accuracy.},

@article{Kambara2013,
abstract = {To understand the mechanism of neural motor control, it is important to clarify how the central nervous system organizes the coordination of redundant muscles. Previous studies suggested that muscle activity for step-tracking wrist movements are optimized so as to reduce total effort or end-point variance under neural noise. However, since the muscle dynamics were assumed as a simple linear system, some characteristic patterns of experimental EMG were not seen in the simulated muscle activity of the previous studies. The biological muscle is known to have dynamic properties in which its elasticity and viscosity depend on activation level. The motor control system is supposed to consider the viscoelasticity of the muscles when generating motor command signals. In this study, we present a computational motor control model that can control a musculoskeletal system with non-linear dynamics. We applied the model to step-tracking wrist movements actuated by five muscles with dynamic viscoelastic properties. To solve the motor redundancy, we designed the control model to generate motor commands that maximize end-point accuracy under signal-dependent noise, while minimizing the squared sum of them. Here, we demonstrate that the muscle activity simulated by our model exhibit spatiotemporal features of experimentally observed muscle activity of human and non-human primates. In addition, we show that the movement trajectories resulting from the simulated muscle activity resemble experimentally observed trajectories. These results suggest that, by utilizing inherent viscoelastic properties of the muscles, the neural system may optimize muscle activity to improve motor performance.},

abstract = {The separate and combined depressive effects induced by vibration and standing on the soleus H-reflex have been studied by administering Achilles' tendon vibration in prone position and during stance. Without vibration, H-reflex amplitude was larger under prone than standing condition. Vibration reduced the reflex both in prone position and even more during stance. When vibration was superimposed to inclined stance (greater EMG background), the reflex was reduced of the same absolute amount as when it was superimposed to normal stance. When vibration was superimposed on stance with minimal or no background EMG, the reflex disappeared. These results confirm that both upright posture and vibration have a strong depressive effect on the H-reflex. They also show that muscle activity during stance is enough for overcoming the reflex depression. These findings provide information about the origin of the disfacilitatory effects on the monosynaptic reflex pathway, contribute to the understanding of the posture-related mechanisms responsible for the modulation of the spinal reflex excitability, and allow arguing in favour of a minor but adaptable role for the short latency stretch reflex in the control of quiet unperturbed stance.},

abstract = {Contractile properties of human motor units provide information on the force capacity and fatigability of muscles. The spike-triggered averaging technique (STA) is a conventional method used to estimate the twitch waveform of single motor units in vivo by averaging the joint force signal. Several limitations of this technique have been previously discussed in an empirical way, using simulated and experimental data. In this study, we provide a theoretical analysis of this technique in the frequency domain and describe its intrinsic limitations. By analyzing the analytical expression of STA, first we show that a certain degree of correlation between the motor unit activities prevents an accurate estimation of the twitch force, even from relatively long recordings. Second, we show that the quality of the twitch estimates by STA is highly related to the relative variability of the inter-spike intervals of motor unit action potentials. Interestingly, if this variability is extremely high, correct estimates could be obtained even for high discharge rates. However, for physiological inter-spike interval variability and discharge rate, the technique performs with relatively low estimation accuracy and high estimation variance. Finally, we show that the selection of the triggers that are most distant from the previous and next, which is often suggested, is not an effective way for improving STA estimates and in some cases can even be detrimental. These results show the intrinsic limitations of the STA technique and provide a theoretical framework for the design of new methods for the measurement of motor unit force twitch.},

An attractive feature of the method is that it can be used in spike-triggered mode to quantify the distinct patterns of post-spike refractoriness seen in different classes of cortical neuron. The method is first illustrated using a conductance-based model and is then applied experimentally to generate reduced models of cortical layer-5 pyramidal cells and interneurons, in injected-current and injected- conductance protocols. The resulting low-dimensional neuron models-of the refractory exponential integrate-and-fire type-provide highly accurate predictions for spike-times. The method therefore provides a useful tool for the construction of tractable models and rapid experimental classification of cortical neurons.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess postural stabilization skill in adult subjects affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 1A. For this purpose ground reaction force (GRF) was measured by means of a piezoelectric force platform during the sit-to-stand (STS) movement, until a steady state erect posture was achieved. Specific indexes to quantify Centre of Mass acceleration, both during postural stabilization and during quiet standing, were computed using a mathematical model. Forty-seven CMT1A subjects were recruited for the study, and the control group was formed by forty-one age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The results show that CMT1A subjects are less stable than controls during the quiet stance. Greater difficulty (high values of Yinf, the final instability rate) to maintain erect posture appears to be mainly associated with plantar-flexor muscle weakness, rather than to damage of the proprioceptive system. The worst performances shown by CMT1A subjects in the stabilization phase (high values of I, the global index of postural stabilization performance) seem to be associated with reduced muscle strength and the loss of large sensory nerve fibres. Distal muscle weakness appears to affect both postural stabilization and quiet erect posture. The presented protocol and the analysis of postural stabilization parameters provide useful information on CMT1A balance disorders. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of forward dynamic neuromusculoskeletal modeling. The aim of such models is to estimate or predict muscle forces, joint moments, and/or joint kinematics from neural signals. This is a four-step process. In the first step, muscle activation dynamics govern the transformation from the neural signal to a measure of muscle activation-a time varying parameter between 0 and 1. In the second step, muscle contraction dynamics characterize how muscle activations are transformed into muscle forces. The third step requires a model of the musculoskeletal geometry to transform muscle forces to joint moments. Finally, the equations of motion allow joint moments to be transformed into joint movements. Each step involves complex nonlinear relationships. The focus of this paper is on the details involved in the first two steps, since these are the most challenging to the biomechanician. The global process is then explained through applications to the study of predicting isometric elbow moments and dynamic knee kinetics.},

@article{Day2013,
abstract = {To maintain a stable, upright posture, the central nervous system (CNS) must integrate sensory information from multiple sources and subsequently generate corrective torque about the ankle joint. Although proprioceptive information from the muscles that cross this joint has been shown to be vital in this process, the specific source of this information remains questionable. Recent research has been focused on the potential role of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle during standing, largely due to the lack of modulation of its activity throughout the sway cycle. Ten young, healthy subjects were asked to stand normally under varying conditions, for periods of 60 s. During these trials, intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) activity and the fascicle length of three distinct anatomical regions of TA were sampled synchronously with kinematic data regarding sway position. In the quiet standing conditions, TA muscle activity was unmodulated and fascicle length changes in each region were tightly coupled with changes in sway position. In the active sway condition, more EMG activity was observed in TA and the fascicle length changes were decoupled from sway position. No regional specific differences in correlation values were observed, contrasting previous observations. The ability of the fascicles to follow sway position builds upon the suggestion that TA is well placed to provide accurate, straightforward sensory information to the CNS. As previously suggested, through reciprocal inhibition, afferent information from TA could help to regulate plantar flexor torque at relevant phases of the sway cycle. The proprioceptive role of TA appears to become complicated during more challenging conditions.},

First published June 16, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.01018.2009. We used surface EMG signal decomposition technology to study the control properties of numerous simultaneously active motor units. Six healthy human subjects of comparable age (21 +/- 0.63 yr) and physical fitness were recruited to perform isometric contractions of the vastus lateralis (VL), first dorsal interosseous (FDI), and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles at the 20, 50, 80, and 100{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum voluntary contraction force levels. EMG signals were collected with a five-pin surface array sensor that provided four channels of data. They were decomposed into the constituent action potentials with a new decomposition algorithm. The firings of a total of 1,273 motor unit action potential trains, 20-30 per contraction, were obtained. The recruitment thresholds and mean firing rates of the motor units were calculated, and mathematical equations were derived. The results describe a hierarchical inverse relationship between the recruitment thresholds and the firing rates, including the first and second derivatives, i.e., the velocity and the acceleration of the firing rates. This relationship describes an "operating point" for the motoneuron pool that remains consistent at all force levels and is modulated by the excitation. This relationship differs only slightly between subjects and more distinctly across muscles. These results support the "onion skin" property that suggests a basic control scheme encoded in the physical properties of motoneurons that responds consistently to a "common drive" to the motoneuron pool.},

abstract = {The documented impact of contractile level on decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered averaging motor unit number estimates (MUNEs) in young adults demonstrates the importance of selecting an objective contraction intensity that yields the most representative MUNE for a given muscle. Whether the same contraction intensity would be ideal in an altered system (e.g., by aging or disease) has yet to be examined. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to compare the effects of contraction intensity on MUNEs from the soleus muscle in young ( approximately 27 years) and old ( approximately 75 years) men. Using decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered averaging, surface and intramuscular electromyographic signals were collected from the soleus during a range of submaximal isometric plantar-flexion contractions (threshold, 10{\{}{\%}{\}}, 20{\{}{\%}{\}}, and 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximum voluntary contraction; MVC). Five MUNEs were calculated, one for each of the four contraction intensities and an ensemble MUNE was derived from all MUs collected. Although MUNE decreased similarly with increased effort in both groups, MUNEs were not significantly reduced in the old men compared to the young men. Consequently, the ensemble MUNE was extrapolated to an intensity of approximately 15{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC in both young and old. The results suggest that, in the soleus, the use of the same contraction intensity across age groups is a valid comparison.},

However, construction of correlation network is computationally expensive, especially when the number of neurons is large and this prohibits realtime applications. This paper proposes a hardware architecture using hierarchical systolic arrays to reconstruct the correlation network. Through mapping an efficient algorithm for cross-correlation onto a massively parallel structure, the hardware can accomplish the network construction with extremely small delay. The proposed structure is evaluated using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Results show that our method is three orders of magnitudes faster than the software approach using desktop computer. This new method enables real-time network construction and leads to future novel devices of realtime neuronal network monitoring and rehabilitation.},

Parameters for the muscle and receptor models were chosen independently to match their responses in isolation. Reflex gains and gamma inputs were estimated to fit the response to stretch measured by Nichols and Houk. The chosen reflex gains and gamma inputs are not unique; many different combinations reproduced the characteristic stretch response. With a single set of fixed parameters, the model predicted many mechanical properties of the stretch reflex, including linearization effects (when the stretch magnitude and direction are varied), as well as the dependence on operating force and initial muscle length. The model did not accurately predict the responses at higher stretch velocities, due to failure of the extrafusal muscle model. (C) 2002 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {1. The relative degree of glycogen degradation, caused in different fibre types by supramaximal electrical activation of the muscle nerve, was investigated in m. gastrocnemius medialis of young adult rats under general pentobarbitone anaesthesia. Pour different protocols of intermittent maximal tetanic activation were used, each lasting 6 s (33{\%} duty cycle; fast and slow isovelocity concentric (shortening) contractions, brief- and long-burst isometric contractions; 6 rats per group). All contractions were evoked under ischaemic conditions. 2. Work output finally dropped to 29{\%} of the initial value for the fast concentric and to 87{\%} for the slow concentric contractions. In isometric protocols evoked by the same stimulation patterns, the force x time area rose to 110{\%} for brief-burst contractions and dropped to 95{\%} for the long-burst contractions. 3. Following the Physiological procedures, the experimental muscle and its contralateral control were removed and prepared for histochemical analysis. Serial sections were stained for glycogen (periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) method) and myofibrillar ATPase (mATPase), the latter reactions being used for classifying the fibres as types I, IIA, IIBd and IIBm. 4. For deep 'red' regions of non-stimulated contralateral control muscles the optical density of PAS staining was ranked between fibre types such that I < IIA < IIBd < IIBm. In superficial 'white' regions of the same muscles, no significant difference in PAS staining density was found between IIBd and IIBm fibres (types I and IIA not present). 5. All contractile protocols produced a significant glycogen degradation in IIBm fibres, and the fast concentric activation procedure was associated with a significant decline of PAS staining in all fibre types. For all activation protocols, the relative degree of glycogen degradation within a given region was ranked such that IIBm > IIBd > IIA > I. For IIBm vs. IIBd fibres, the differences in relative degradation were greater and more consistently significant for superficial white regions than in the deeper red muscle portions. 6. The results are discussed in relation to glycogen degradation measurements in studies of motor unit recruitment. Furthermore, the results from red vs. white muscle regions underline that fibres of seemingly the same mATPase type may differ considerably in other properties.},

abstract = {Lumbar motoneurones were recorded intracellularly during fictive locomotion induced by stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region in decerebrate cats. After blocking the action potentials using intracellular QX-314, and by using a discontinuous current clamp, it is shown that the excitatory component of the locomotor drive potentials behaves in a voltage-dependent manner, such that its amplitude increases with depolarisation. As the input to motoneurones during locomotion is comprised of alternating excitation and inhibition, it was desirable to examine the excitatory input in relative isolation. This was accomplished in spinalised decerebrate cats treated with nialamide and L-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) by studying the excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked from the ''flexor reflex afferents'' (FRA) and extensor Ib afferents, both of which are likely to be mediated via the locomotor network. As expected, these EPSPs also demonstrate a voltage-dependent increase in amplitude. In addition, the input to motoneurones from the network for scratching, which is thought to share interneurones with the locomotor network, also results in voltage-dependent excitation. The possible underlying mechanisms of NMDA-mediated excitation and plateau potentials are discussed: both may contribute to the observed effect. It is suggested that this nonlinear increase in excitation contributes to the mechanisms involved in the production of the high rates of repetitive firing of motoneurones typically seen during locomotion, thus ensuring appropriate muscle contraction.},

abstract = {Chronic activity patterns, such as strength training, limb immobilization, and aging, produce marked adaptations in both the muscular and nervous systems. In this brief review, some of the involved mechanisms are examined as they are revealed through studies on the maximality, specificity, and pattern of the neural drive to muscle. The studies on maximality indicate that it is difficult to activate maximally a muscle by voluntary command, the capacity varies across muscles, tasks, and training, and the maximum discharge rates of motor neurons decreases with immobilization and increases with strength training. The data on specificity demonstrate that: strength can be increased by training with imagined contractions; the velocity specificity of isokinetic training is evident with intended contractions; the strength training influences the untrained homologous muscle in the contralateral limb; the bilatral deficit can become a bilateral facilitation with appropriate training; and that eccentric contractions appear to involve a different activation scheme compared to isometric and concentric contractions. Finally, the literature on the pattern of the neural drive suggests that: coactivation varies with training and often decreases as skill level increases; measures of motor-unit synchronization reveal changes in neuronal connectivity with physical training; the reflex potentiation varies across muscles, individuals, and activity patterns; the modulation of the H-reflex amplitude with training involves changes in the motor neuron; and the motor neurons exhibit a bistable, excitability property that may be influenced by exercise. Despite the breadth of this evidence, there remain substantial gaps in our knowledge, particularly regarding the symmetry of adaptations with increased and decreased chronic physical activity.

abstract = {Although the reproducibility of motor unit number estimation (MUNE) for groups of subjects has been studied, there is little such data for individuals. Prediction intervals represent a tool to study individual MUNE reproducibility and represent the range of values expected for a future MUNE if the true number of motor units remains unchanged. MUNE was performed using the statistical method on 48 normal individuals. The prediction interval was found to be a function of the intrasubject coefficient of variation. Using a commercial manufacturer's recommended technique and software, prediction intervals were found to be so broad as to be of uncertain value. We found that by averaging two MUNE observations for each determination, and using the method of weighted averages for calculating the size of an average single motor unit potential, the intrasubject coefficient of variation was reduced from 16.48{\%} to 8.77{\%}, and the 90{\%} prediction interval became sufficiently narrow to be clinically useful. False-negative rates were also lowered substantially using these techniques. Thus, simple modifications of an existing MUNE program improved the clinical utility of this program for the longitudinal study of patients in whom changes in motor unit number over time are of importance, such as those with motor neuron diseases.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to improve the ability of a motor unit model to predict experimentally measured force variability across a wide range of forces. Motor unit discharge characteristics were obtained from 38 motor units of the first dorsal interosseus muscle. Motor unit discharges were recorded in separate isometric contractions that ranged from 4 to 85{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force above recruitment threshold. High-threshold motor units exhibited both greater minimal and peak discharge rates compared with low-threshold units (P < 0.01). Minimal discharge rate increased from 7 to 23 pps, and peak discharge rate increased from 14 to 38 pps with an increase in recruitment threshold. Relative discharge rate variability ( CV) decreased exponentially for each motor unit from an average of 30 to 13{\%} as index finger force increased above recruitment threshold. In separate experiments, force variability was assessed at eight force levels from 2 to 95{\%} MVC. The CV for force decreased from 4.9 to 1.4{\%} as force increased from 2 to 15{\%} MVC (P < 0.01) and remained constant at higher forces (1.2-1.9{\%}; P = 0.14). When the motor unit model was revised using these experimental findings, discharge rate variability was the critical factor that resulted in no significant difference between simulated and experimental force variability (P = 0.22) at all force levels. These results support the hypothesis that discharge rate variability is a major determinant of the trends in isometric force variability across the working range of a muscle.},

abstract = {Patients with chronic bilateral loss of vestibular functions normally replace these by visual or haptic referencing to stationary surroundings, resulting in an almost normal stance control. But with eyes closed, they show abnormally large body sway, and may tend to fall when there are external disturbances to the body or when standing on an unstable support surface. Patients' postural responses depend on joint angle proprioception and ground reaction-force cues (occasionally referred to as "somatosensory graviception"). It is asked why the force cues do not allow patients to fully substitute loss of the vestibular cues. In recent years, four sets of observations of experimental situations where patients, eyes closed, show impaired stance control or even may fall were identified: (1) with unstable or compliant support ("inevitable falls"); (2) with large external disturbances such as support surface tilts or pull stimuli impacting on their bodies (leading to abnormally large body movements); (3) with fast body-support tilts (also abnormally large body movements); and (4) with transient support tilt (overshooting body-support stabilization and abnormaly late body-space [BS] stabilization). When patients' data were modeled, it was found that their problems stem mainly from the force cues. It was hypothesized that patients have difficulties decomposing this sensory information into its constituents in order to be able to get rid of an active force component. Normals do not have this difficulty, because the vestibular system performs the decomposition.},

abstract = {Motoneuron (MN) dendrites may be changed from a passive to an active state by increasing the levels of spinal cord neuromodulators, which activate persistent inward currents (PICs). These exert a powerful influence on MN behavior and modify the motor control both in normal and pathological conditions. Motoneuronal PICs are believed to induce nonlinear phenomena such as the genesis of extra torque and torque hysteresis in response to percutaneous electrical stimulation or tendon vibration in humans. An existing large-scale neuromuscular simulator was expanded to include MN models that have a capability to change their dynamic behaviors depending on the neuromodulation level. The simulation results indicated that the variability (standard deviation) of a maintained force depended on the level of neuromodulatory activity. A force with lower variability was obtained when the motoneuronal network was under a strong influence of PICs, suggesting a functional role in postural and precision tasks. In an additional set of simulations when PICs were active in the dendrites of the MN models, the results successfully reproduced experimental results reported from humans. Extra torque was evoked by the self-sustained discharge of spinal MNs, whereas differences in recruitment and de-recruitment levels of the MNs were the main reason behind torque and electromyogram (EMG) hysteresis. Finally, simulations were also used to study the influence of inhibitory inputs on a MN pool that was under the effect of PICs. The results showed that inhibition was of great importance in the production of a phasic force, requiring a reduced co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. These results show the richness of functionally relevant behaviors that can arise from a MN pool under the action of PICs.},

Twenty-seven single motor units were recorded from 5 volunteers by surface electrodes, which were confirmed by subsequent needle electrode recordings. Twitch tension ranged from 0.6 to 10.0 g with a mean of 3.7 g based on an averaging method triggered by surface myoelectric signals, and the tension calculated from the needle myoelectric signals ranged from 0.8 to 11.7 g with a mean of 3.6 g. Rise time ranged from 33.9 to 81.6 msec with a mean of 49.4 msec for the surface electrode recordings, and from 33.0 to 73.2 msec with a mean of 50.8 msec for the needle electrode recordings. The obtained data of surface electrode recordings indicated a high correlation with that of the needle electrode recordings, r = 0.92 (P < 0.001) for twitch tension and r = 0.91 (P < 0.001) for rise time. We also found a positive correlation between threshold force and twitch tension (by surface electrodes: r = 0.71, P < 0.05; by needle electrodes: r = 0.77, P < 0.05). Our studies indicate that it is possible to record single motor units by non-invasive surface electrodes provided that the unit has a threshold force of less than 2 kg.},

However, not all subjects exhibit a response to the perturbation. Determining whether or not a response has occurred is usually done qualitatively, e.g., by visual inspection of the power spectrum. In this paper, we present the application of a statistical test for quantifying whether or not a postural sway response is present. The test uses an F-statistic for determining if there is significant power in postural sway data at the stimulus frequency. In order to describe the application of this method, 20 subjects viewed sinusoidal anterior-posterior (A-P) optic flow at 0.1 and 0.25 Hz, while their A-P head translation was measured. The test showed that significant postural responses were detected at the stimulus frequency in 12/20 subjects at 0.1 Hz and 13/20 subjects at 0.25 Hz.},

abstract = {This study aims to quantify the separate contributions of muscle force feedback, muscle spindle activity and co-contraction to the performance of voluntary tasks ("reduce the influence of perturbations on maintained force or position"). Most human motion control studies either isolate only one contributor, or assume that relevant reflexive feedback pathways during voluntary disturbance rejection tasks originate mainly from the muscle spindle. Human ankle-control experiments were performed, using three task instructions and three perturbation characteristics to evoke a wide range of responses to force perturbations. During position tasks, subjects (n = 10) resisted the perturbations, becoming more stiff than when being relaxed (i.e., the relax task). During force tasks, subjects were instructed to minimize force changes and actively gave way to imposed forces, thus becoming more compliant than during relax tasks. Subsequently, linear physiological models were fitted to the experimental data. Inhibitory, as well as excitatory force feedback, was needed to account for the full range of measured experimental behaviors. In conclusion, force feedback plays an important role in the studied motion control tasks (excitatory during position tasks and inhibitory during force tasks), implying that spindle-mediated feedback is not the only significant adaptive system that contributes to the maintenance of posture or force.},

abstract = {The knowledge of surface electromyography (SEMG) and the number of applications have increased considerably during the past ten years. However, most methodological developments have taken place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the different groups of users. A specific objective of the European concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This paper will present the process and the results of the development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and sensor placement procedures. Execution of the SENIAM sensor tasks, in the period 1996-1999, has been handled in a number of partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics. Based on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and also sent to all members of the SENIAM club (>100 members) together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG sensors and sensor placement properties as well as practical guidelines for the proper use of SEMG. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Under many conditions spinal motoneurons produce plateau potentials, resulting in self-sustained firing and providing a mechanism for translating short-lasting synaptic inputs into long-lasting motor output. During the acute-stage of spinal cord injury (SCI), the endogenous ability to generate plateaus is lost; however, during the chronic-stage of SCI, plateau potentials reappear with prolonged self-sustained firing that has been implicated in the development of spasticity. In this work, we extend previous modeling studies to systematically investigate the mechanisms underlying the generation of plateau potentials in motoneurons, including the influences of specific ionic currents, the morphological characteristics of the soma and dendrite, and the interactions between persistent inward currents and synaptic input. In particular, the goal of these computational studies is to explore the possible interactions between morphological and electrophysiological changes that occur after incomplete SCI. Model results predict that some of the morphological changes generally associated with the chronic-stage for some types of spinal cord injuries can cause a decrease in self-sustained firing. This and other computational results presented here suggest that the observed increases in self-sustained firing following some types of SCI may occur mainly due to changes in membrane conductances and changes in synaptic activity, particularly changes in the strength and timing of inhibition.},

abstract = {The motor unit number index (MUNIX) is a method for assessment of number and size (MUSIX) of motor units (MUs) using the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and surface electromyographic interference pattern (SIP). This method was used to study the hypothenar muscle in 34 healthy subjects to define normal range, and to study reproducibility. Four healthy subjects and 13 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were studied serially over a 1-year period. In healthy subjects, MUNIX showed good reproducibility. In serial studies, healthy subjects showed no change in the CMAP amplitude and MUNIX. ALS patients with minimal change in CMAP amplitude had a significant drop in MUNIX and increase in MUSIX, indicating MU loss compensated by reinnervation. When the CMAP changed significantly (>30{\{}{\%}{\}}) in 1 year, the CMAP and MUNIX decreased in parallel. MUNIX would be useful to study MU loss in degenerative diseases of motor neurons.

abstract = {The intrinsic viscoelastic properties of muscle are central to many theories of motor control. Much of the debate over these theories hinges on varying interpretations of these muscle properties. In the present study, we describe methods whereby a comprehensive musculoskeletal model can be used to make inferences about motor control strategies that would account for behavioral data. Muscle activity and kinematic data from a monkey were recorded while the animal performed a single degree-of-freedom pointing task in the presence of pseudo-random torque perturbations. The monkey's movements were simulated by a musculoskeletal model with accurate representations of musculotendon morphometry and contractile properties. The model was used to quantify the impedance of the limb while moving rapidly, the differential action of synergistic muscles, the relative contribution of reflexes to task performance and the completeness of recorded EMG signals. Current methods to address these issues in the absence of musculoskeletal models were compared with the methods used in the present study. We conclude that musculoskeletal models and kinetic analysis can improve the interpretation of kinematic and electrophysiological data, in some cases by illuminating shortcomings of the experimental methods or underlying assumptions that may otherwise escape notice.},

Young adults maintained isometric force for extended periods at different levels of their maximum voluntary contraction. Force variability (SD) increased exponentially as a function of force level. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (M/SD), an index of information transmission, as well as measures of noise in both the time (approximate entropy) and frequency (power spectrum) domains, changed according to an inverted U-shaped function over the range of force levels. These findings indicate that force variability is not directly related to noise but that force output noisiness is positively correlated with the amount of information transmitted.},

abstract = {1. One hundred and twenty-four muscle afferents from the finger extensor muscles were recorded from the radial nerve in human subjects. 2. The afferents were provisionally classified as muscle spindle primary (78/124) and secondary afferents (25/124), and Golgi tendon organ afferents (21/124), on the basis of their response to 1) maximal twitch contractions, 2) 20- and 50-Hz sinusoids superimposed on ramp-and-hold stretches, 3) stretch sensitization, and 4) isometric contractions and sudden relaxations. 3. Ramp-and-hold stretches at two velocities, 10 and 50 degrees/s, were applied to the appropriate metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint while the parent muscle remained relaxed. For each unit three discrete parameters were assessed: the presence or absence of 1) an initial burst at the commencement of the ramp stretch, 2) a deceleration response at the beginning of the hold phase, and 3) a prompt silencing at muscle shortening. In addition, two kinds of dynamic indexes were calculated for 79 of the muscle spindle afferents. 4. Most spindle afferents responded readily to stretch, whereas the Golgi tendon organ afferents produced very poor stretch responses. All of them lacked a static response, whereas the dynamic response, when present at all, consisted of only a few impulses. 5. The dynamic index was higher for spindle primaries than for secondaries, and this difference was statistically significant although the distribution was unimodal for spindle afferents as a group. Hence, this parameter was a poor discriminator. 6. Initial bursts, deceleration responses, and silences during imposed shortening were more common in spindle primaries than in secondaries. The differences were significant in all these respects. 7. The three discrete parameters were statistically pairwise independent for the spindle afferents, justifying the combination of the three into a useful battery for discrimination between primary and secondary spindle afferents and the use of this battery as a partial data base for a probability approach towards a solid classification of human muscle afferents.},

abstract = {We investigated whether stimulation of the pyramidal tract (PT) could reset the phase of 15-30 Hz beta oscillations observed in the macaque motor cortex. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and multiple single-unit activity from two conscious macaque monkeys performing a precision grip task. EMG activity was also recorded from the second animal. Single PT stimuli were delivered during the hold period of the task, when oscillations in the LFP were most prominent. Stimulus-triggered averaging of the LFP showed a phase-locked oscillatory response to PT stimulation. Frequency domain analysis revealed two components within the response: a 15-30 Hz component, which represented resetting of on-going beta rhythms, and a lower frequency 10 Hz response. Only the higher frequency could be observed in the EMG activity, at stronger stimulus intensities than were required for resetting the cortical rhythm. Stimulation of the PT during movement elicited a greatly reduced oscillatory response. Analysis of single-unit discharge confirmed that PT stimulation was capable of resetting periodic activity in motor cortex. The firing patterns of pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) and unidentified neurones exhibited successive cycles of suppression and facilitation, time locked to the stimulus. We conclude that PTN activity directly influences the generation of the 15-30 Hz rhythm. These PTNs facilitate EMG activity in upper limb muscles, contributing to corticomuscular coherence at this same frequency. Since the earliest oscillatory effect observed following stimulation was a suppression of firing, we speculate that inhibitory feedback may be the key mechanism generating such oscillations in the motor cortex.},

abstract = {Multichannel surface electromyograms (EMGs) were used to examine the sensitivity of EMG-EMG coherence to infer changes in common oscillatory drive to hand muscles in young and older adults. Previous research has shown that measures of coherence calculated from different neurophysiological signals are influenced by the age of the subject, the visual feedback provided to the subject, and the task being performed. The change in the magnitude of EMG-EMG coherence across experimental conditions is often interpreted as a change in the oscillatory drive to motoneuron pools of a pair of muscles. However, signal processing (e.g., full-wave rectification) and electrode location are also reported to influence EMG-EMG coherence, which could decrease the sensitivity of EMG-EMG coherence to infer a change in common oscillatory drive to motoneurons. In this study, multichannel EMGs were used to compare EMG-EMG coherence in young (n = 11) and older (n = 10) adults during index finger abduction and pinch grip tasks performed at 2 and 3.5 N with a low and a high visual feedback gain. We found that, across all conditions, EMG-EMG coherence was influenced by electrode location (P < 0.001) but not by subject age, visual feedback gain, task, or signal processing. These results suggest that EMG-EMG coherence is most sensitive to electrode location. The results are discussed in terms of the potential issues related to inferring a common oscillatory drive to hand muscles with surface EMGs.},

abstract = {Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are highly specialized glial cells that wrap axons with a multilayered myelin membrane for rapid impulse conduction. Investigators have recently identified axonal signals that recruit myelin-forming Schwann cells from an alternate fate of simple axonal engulfment. This is the evolutionary oldest form of axon-glia interaction, and its function is unknown. Recent observations suggest that oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells not only myelinate axons but also maintain their long-term functional integrity. Mutations in the mouse reveal that axonal support by oligodendrocytes is independent of myelin assembly. The underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood; we do know that to maintain axonal integrity, mammalian myelin-forming cells require the expression of some glia-specific proteins, including CNP, PLP, and MAG, as well as intact peroxisomes, none of which is necessary for myelin assembly. Loss of glial support causes progressive axon degeneration and possibly local inflammation, both of which are likely to contribute to a variety of neuronal diseases in the central and peripheral nervous systems.},

Here, we investigate how the spatial properties of the stimulus shape the afferent response. To that end, we present an analytical framework to characterize SA1 and RA responses to a wide variety of spatial patterns indented into the skin. This framework comprises a model of the tissue deformation produced by any three-dimensional indented spatial pattern, along with an expression that converts the deformation at the receptor site into a neural response. We evaluated 15 candidate variables for the relevant receptor deformation and found that physical quantities closely related to local membrane stretch were most predictive of the observed afferent responses. The main outcome of this study is an accurate working model of SA1 and RA afferent responses to indented spatial patterns.},

abstract = {Nerve conduction studies (NCSs) have played an important role in the evaluation of neuromuscular disease for the past 50 years. When patients present with complaints of pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness, NCS is often one of the earliest tests obtained by physicians, because it enables the quantitative assessment of peripheral nerve and muscle function and, therefore, aid the physician in identifying the physiological source of the patient's symptoms. NCSs involve the delivery of electric stimuli to peripheral nerves at accessible locations on the human body and the recording of electrophysiological responses. This article reviews how NCS is traditionally performed. This paper also examines technical challenges associated with each step of performing an NCS and describes how engineering solutions could be realized to meet these challenges. The engineering goals were several: improvement in NCS workflow, use of prefabricated electrode arrays to standardize NCS technique and reduce the errors associated with electrode placement, and improvement of the overall accuracy and reliability of NCS.},

abstract = {Combined V-wave and Hoffmann (H) reflex measurements were performed during maximal muscle contraction to examine the neural adaptation mechanisms induced by resistance training. The H-reflex can be used to assess the excitability of spinal alpha-motoneurons, while also reflecting transmission efficiency (i.e., presynaptic inhibition) in Ia afferent synapses. Furthermore, the V-wave reflects the overall magnitude of efferent motor output from the alpha-motoneuron pool because of activation from descending central pathways. Fourteen male subjects participated in 14 wk of resistance training that involved heavy weight-lifting exercises for the muscles of the leg. Evoked V-wave, H-reflex, and maximal M-wave (M(max)) responses were recorded before and after training in the soleus muscle during maximal isometric ramp contractions. Maximal isometric, concentric, and eccentric muscle strength was measured by use of isokinetic dynamometry. V-wave amplitude increased approximately 50{\{}{\%}{\}} with training (P < 0.01) from 3.19 +/- 0.43 to 4.86 +/- 0.43 mV, or from 0.308 +/- 0.048 to 0.478 +/- 0.034 when expressed relative to M(max) (+/- SE). H-reflex amplitude increased approximately 20{\{}{\%}{\}} (P < 0.05) from 5.37 +/- 0.41 to 6.24 +/- 0.49 mV, or from 0.514 +/- 0.032 to 0.609 +/- 0.025 when normalized to M(max). In contrast, resting H-reflex amplitude remained unchanged with training (0.503 +/- 0.059 vs. 0.499 +/- 0.063). Likewise, no change occurred in M(max) (10.78 +/- 0.86 vs. 10.21 +/- 0.66 mV). Maximal muscle strength increased 23-30{\{}{\%}{\}} (P < 0.05). In conclusion, increases in evoked V-wave and H-reflex responses were observed during maximal muscle contraction after resistance training. Collectively, the present data suggest that the increase in motoneuronal output induced by resistance training may comprise both supraspinal and spinal adaptation mechanisms (i.e., increased central motor drive, elevated motoneuron excitability, reduced presynaptic inhibition).},

abstract = {When standing quietly, human upright stance is typically approximated as a single segment inverted pendulum. In contrast, investigations, which perturb upright stance with support, surface translations or visual driving stimuli have shown that the body behaves like a two-segment pendulum, displaying both in-phase and anti-phase patterns between the upper and lower body. We have recently shown that these patterns co-exist during quiet stance; in-phase and anti-phase for frequencies below and above 1 Hz, respectively. Here we investigated whether the characteristics of these basic patterns were influenced by the addition or removal of sensory information. Ten healthy young subjects stood upright on a rigid platform with different combinations of sensory information: eyes were open or closed with or without light touch contact (<1N) of the right index fingertip with a 5 cm diameter rigid force plate. The in-phase and anti-phase pattern co-exist in both the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions of sway. The real part of trunk-leg complex coherence decreased with the addition of vision and light touch, corresponding to a transition from the in-phase to anti-phase pattern at a lower frequency. In the AP direction, the decrease was only observed at frequencies below 1 Hz where the in-phase pattern predominates. Additional sensory information had no observable effect at sway frequencies above 1 Hz, where the anti-phase pattern predominates. Both patterns are clearly the result of a double-linked inverted pendulum dynamics, but the coherence of the in-phase pattern is more susceptible to modulation by sensory information than the anti-phase pattern.},

abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.},

@article{Kanai2006,
abstract = {Fasciculations are a characteristic feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and can arise proximally or distally in the motor neuron, indicating a widespread disturbance in membrane excitability. Previous studies of axonal excitability properties (i.e. threshold electrotonus, strength-duration time constant) have suggested respectively that change in potassium or sodium channels may be involved. To reinvestigate these changes and explore their correlation with disease stage, multiple axonal excitability properties (threshold electrotonus, strength-duration time constant, recovery cycle and current-threshold relationship) were measured for the median nerve at the wrist in 58 ALS patients, and compared with 25 age-matched controls. In ALS, there were greater changes in depolarizing threshold electrotonus (i.e. less accommodation) (P < 0.001) and greater supernormality in the recovery cycles (P < 0.001). These abnormalities were more prominent in patients with moderately reduced CMAP (1-5 mV). Modelling the excitability changes in this group supported the hypothesis that axonal potassium conductances are reduced, resulting in increased supernormality despite membrane depolarization. The tendency for strength-duration time constant to be prolonged in ALS was only significant for patients with normal CMAP amplitude (> 5 mV). Patients with severely reduced CMAP (< 1 mV) alone showed reduced threshold changes to hyperpolarizing current. These results suggest a changing pattern of abnormal membrane properties with disease progression. First, persistent Na+ conductance increases, possibly associated with collateral sprouting, and then K+ conductances decline. Both changes cause axonal hyperexcitability, and may contribute to the generation of fasciculations. These serial changes in axonal properties could provide insights into the pathophysiology of ALS, and implications for future therapeutic options.},

abstract = {Although current knowledge attributes movement disorders to a dysfunction of the basal ganglia-motor cortex circuits, abnormalities in the peripheral afferent inputs or in their central processing may interfere with motor program execution. We review the abnormalities of sensorimotor integration described in the various types of movement disorders. Several observations, including those of parkinsonian patients' excessive reliance on ongoing visual information during movement tasks, suggest that proprioception is defective in Parkinson's disease (PD). The disturbance of proprioceptive regulation, possibly related to the occurrence of abnormal muscle-stretch reflexes, might be important for generating hypometric or bradykinetic movements. Studies with somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), prepulse inhibition, and event-related potentials support the hypothesis of central abnormalities of sensorimotor integration in PD. In Huntington's disease (HD), changes in SEPs and long-latency stretch reflexes suggest that a defective gating of peripheral afferent input to the brain might impair sensorimotor integration in cortical motor areas, thus interfering with the processing of motor programs. Defective motor programming might contribute to some features of motor impairment in HD. Sensory symptoms are frequent in focal dystonia and sensory manipulation can modify the dystonic movements. In addition, specific sensory functions (kinaesthesia, spatial-temporal discrimination) can be impaired in patients with focal hand dystonia, thus leading to a "sensory overflow." Sensory input may be abnormal and trigger focal dystonia, or defective "gating" may cause an input-output mismatch in specific motor programs. Altogether, several observations strongly support the idea that sensorimotor integration is impaired in focal dystonia. Although elemental sensation is normal in patients with tics, tics can be associated with sensory phenomena. Some neurophysiological studies suggest that an altered "gating" mechanism also underlies the development of tics. This review underlines the importance of abnormal sensorimotor integration in the pathophysiology of movement disorders. Although the physiological mechanism remains unclear, the defect is of special clinical relevance in determining the development of focal dystonia},

abstract = {There are infinitely many different combinations of arm postures which will place the hand at the same point in space. Given this abundance, how is one configuration chosen over another? Two main hypotheses have been proposed to solve this problem. Postural models suggest that the posture adopted is purely determined by the desired hand position (known as Donders' law). Transport models suggest that the adopted posture depends on where the hand has moved from. A specific transport model, the minimum work model, has been proposed in which the adopted posture is the one that minimizes the amount of work required to move the hand to the new location. The postural model predicts that the posture will be independent of where the hand has moved from, whereas the transport models predict that the posture will depend on the previous posture. We have devised a simple redundant task-touching a target bar using a hand-held virtual stick-to examine these models. The results show that neither model alone can account for the data. We propose a control planning strategy in which there is a combined cost function that has both a postural term as well as a transport term.},

abstract = {Synchronous 25- to 35-Hz oscillations were observed in local field potentials and unit activity in sensorimotor cortex of awake rhesus monkeys. The oscillatory episodes occurred often when the monkeys retrieved raisins from a Kl{\"{u}}ver board or from unseen locations using somatosensory feedback; they occurred less often during performance of repetitive wrist flexion and extension movements. The amplitude, duration, and frequency of oscillations were not directly related to movement parameters in behaviors studied so far. The occurrence of the oscillations was not consistently related to bursts of activity in forearm muscles, but cycle-triggered averages of electromyograms revealed synchronous modulation in flexor and extensor muscles. The phase of the oscillations changed continuously from the surface to the deeper layers of the cortex, reversing their polarity completely at depths exceeding 800 microns. The oscillations could become synchronized over a distance of 14 mm mediolaterally in precentral cortex. Coherent oscillations could also occur at pre- and postcentral sites separated by an estimated tangential intracortical distance of 20 mm. Activity of single units was commonly seen to burst in synchrony with field potential oscillations. These findings suggest that such oscillations may facilitate interactions between cells during exploratory and manipulative movements, requiring attention to sensorimotor integration.},

abstract = {Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded in seven unanaesthetized patients between the four adjacent contacts of a macroelectrode stereotactically implanted for the treatment of tremor. The LFPs were presumed to arise predominantly from the nucleus ventralis intermedius (Vim) of the thalamus, the implantation target. They were recorded simultaneously with the ipsilateral EEG and contralateral EMG during an isometric contraction or at rest. The patients had a history of either isolated tremor (essential tremor, n = 2; benign tremulous Parkinson's disease, n = 1) or tremor with signs of a cerebellar syndrome (multiple sclerosis, n = 3; essential tremor and ataxia, n = 1), although clinical tremor was absent at the time of recording because of a temporary microthalamotomy effect in four patients. In patients with isolated tremor, oscillatory activity picked up by contacts in Vim (cerebellar thalamus) was invariably coherent with that in the sensorimotor cortex or contracting muscle in the 8-27 Hz range. Such coherence was absent in two of the four subjects with tremor associated with a cerebellar syndrome. Coherence between LFPs recorded from more caudally placed contacts and the sensorimotor cortex or contracting muscle was negligible in all patients. These caudally placed contacts demonstrated the highest sensory evoked potential in response to median nerve stimulation. Oscillatory activity in the cerebellar thalamus (Vim) lagged behind that in both cortex and muscle. Coherent activity between the cerebellar thalamus (Vim) and the cortex persisted at rest. It is suggested that rhythmicities in the 8-27 Hz range could provide the basis for a temporal framework that is widely distributed within the motor system.},

abstract = {We analyzed the standing balance control of 11 healthy subjects and 15 subjects with bilateral vestibular hypofunction (BVH) using phase plane (velocity versus displacement) plots. We hypothesized that maintaining postural stability requires control of both the position and momentum of the center of gravity (CG) and infer that it is advantageous to use both velocity and displacement data to characterize balance control. Phase plane plots provide insight into this dynamic aspect of balance control. We evaluated phase plane plots based on whole body CG and center of pressure (CoP). We varied stability by altering the base of support and visual information. Three different foot placements were used: feet wide apart, feet together, and semitandem stance. Feet together standing was performed with eyes open and with eyes closed. The phase plane plots show changes in stability as base of support is altered or visual input is removed and reveal stability differences between the control and BVH groups. The root mean square variance of velocity and displacement was used to quantify the phase plane information. This parameter showed significant differences between activities and between groups. We conclude that phase plane plots that combine displacement and velocity information are more useful in characterizing balance control than displacement or velocity alone.},

The H-reflex was strongly depressed for a period lasting up to 300-400 ms (depression to 48 +/- 23{\%}, mean +/- SD, of control at a conditioning test interval of 70 ms) by the biceps femoris tendon tap. In contrast, the short-latency soleus stretch reflex elicited by a quick passive dorsiflexion of the ankle joint was not depressed. The soleus T-reflex elicited by an Achilles tendon tap was only weakly depressed (92 +/- 8{\%}). The H-reflex was also significantly more depressed than the T-reflex at long intervals (>15 ms) after stimulation of CPN (H-reflex 63 +/- 14{\%}, T-reflex 91 +/- 13{\%}; P < 0. 01). However, the short-latency (2 ms) disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition evoked by stimulation of CPN was equally strong for H- and T-reflexes (H-reflex 72 +/- 10{\%}, T-reflex 67 +/- 13{\%}; P = 0.07). Peaks in the poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) of the discharge probability of single soleus motor units (n = 53) elicited by an Achilles tendon tap had a longer duration than peaks evoked by electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve (on average 5.0 ms as compared with 2.7 ms). All parts of the electrically evoked peaks were depressed by the conditioning biceps femoris tendon tap (average depression to 55 +/- 27{\%} of control; P < 0.001). A similar depression was observed for the initial 2 ms of the peaks evoked by the Achilles tendon tap (69 +/- 48{\%}; P < 0.001), but the last 2 ms were not depressed. Conditioning stimulation of the CPN at long intervals (>15 ms) also depressed all parts of the electrically evoked PSTH peaks (n = 34; average 65{\%}; P < 0.001) but had only a significant effect on the initial 2 ms of the peaks evoked by the Achilles tendon tap (85{\%}; P < 0.001). We suggest that the different sensitivity of mechanically and electrically evoked reflexes to presynaptic inhibition is caused by a difference in the shape and composition of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials underlying the two reflexes. This difference may be explained by a different composition and/or temporal dispersion of the afferent volleys evoked by electrical and mechanical stimuli. We conclude that it is not straightforward to predict the modulation of stretch reflexes based on observations of H-reflex modulation.},

abstract = {Surface EMG (SEMG) is little used for diagnostic purposes in clinical neurophysiology, mainly because it provides little direct information on individual motor units (MUs). One of the techniques to estimate the MU size is intra-muscular Macro EMG. The present study compares SEMG with Macro EMG. Fifty-eight channel SEMG was recorded simultaneously with Macro EMG. Individual MUPs were obtained by single fiber triggered averaging. All recordings were made from the biceps brachii of healthy subjects during voluntary contraction at low force. High positive correlations were found between all Macro and Surface motor unit potential (MUP) parameters: area, peak-to-peak amplitude, negative peak amplitude and positive peak amplitude. The MUPs recorded with SEMG were dependent on the distance between the MU and the skin surface. Normalizing the SEMG parameters for MU location did not improve the correlation coefficient between the parameters of both techniques. The two measurement techniques had almost the same relative range in MUP parameters in any individual subject compared to the others, especially after normalizing the surface MUP parameters for MU location. MUPs recorded with this type of SEMG provide useful information about the MU size. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The dorsal-side-up body posture in standing quadrupeds is maintained by the postural system, which includes spinal and supraspinal mechanisms driven by somatosensory inputs from the limbs. A number of descending tracts can transmit supraspinal commands for postural corrections. The first aim of this study was to understand whether the rubrospinal tract participates in their transmission. We recorded activity of red nucleus neurons (RNNs) in the cat maintaining balance on the periodically tilting platform. Most neurons were identified as rubrospinal ones. It was found that many RNNs were profoundly modulated by tilts, suggesting that they transmit postural commands. The second aim of this study was to examine the contribution of sensory inputs from individual limbs to posture-related RNN modulation. Each RNN was recorded during standing on all four limbs, as well as when two or three limbs were lifted from the platform and could not signal platform displacements. By comparing RNN responses in different tests, we found that the amplitude and phase of responses in the majority of RNNs were determined primarily by sensory input from the corresponding (fore or hind) contralateral limb, whereas inputs from other limbs made a much smaller contribution to RNN modulation. These findings suggest that the rubrospinal system is primarily involved in the intralimb postural coordination, i.e., in the feedback control of the corresponding limb and, to a lesser extent, in the interlimb coordination. This study provides a new insight into the formation of supraspinal motor commands for postural corrections.},

abstract = {When we make saccadic eye movements or goal-directed arm movements, there is an infinite number of possible trajectories that the eye or arm could take to reach the target. However, humans show highly stereotyped trajectories in which velocity profiles of both the eye and hand are smooth and symmetric for brief movements. Here we present a unifying theory of eye and arm movements based on the single physiological assumption that the neural control signals are corrupted by noise whose variance increases with the size of the control signal. We propose that in the presence of such signal-dependent noise, the shape of a trajectory is selected to minimize the variance of the final eye or arm position. This minimum-variance theory accurately predicts the trajectories of both saccades and arm movements and the speed-accuracy trade-off described by Fitt's law. These profiles are robust to changes in the dynamics of the eye or arm, as found empirically. Moreover, the relation between path curvature and hand velocity during drawing movements reproduces the empirical 'two-thirds power law. This theory provides a simple and powerful unifying perspective for both eye and arm movement control.},

abstract = {Despite its century-old use, the interpretation of local field potentials (LFPs), the low-frequency part of electrical signals recorded in the brain, is still debated. In cortex the LFP appears to mainly stem from transmembrane neuronal currents following synaptic input, and obvious questions regarding the 'locality' of the LFP are: What is the size of the signal-generating region, i.e., the spatial reach, around a recording contact? How far does the LFP signal extend outside a synaptically activated neuronal population? And how do the answers depend on the temporal frequency of the LFP signal? Experimental inquiries have given conflicting results, and we here pursue a modeling approach based on a well-established biophysical forward-modeling scheme incorporating detailed reconstructed neuronal morphologies in precise calculations of population LFPs including thousands of neurons. The two key factors determining the frequency dependence of LFP are the spatial decay of the single-neuron LFP contribution and the conversion of synaptic input correlations into correlations between single-neuron LFP contributions. Both factors are seen to give low-pass filtering of the LFP signal power. For uncorrelated input only the first factor is relevant, and here a modest reduction (<50{\{}{\%}{\}}) in the spatial reach is observed for higher frequencies (>100 Hz) compared to the near-DC ([Formula: see text]) value of about [Formula: see text]. Much larger frequency-dependent effects are seen when populations of pyramidal neurons receive correlated and spatially asymmetric inputs: the low-frequency ([Formula: see text]) LFP power can here be an order of magnitude or more larger than at 60 Hz. Moreover, the low-frequency LFP components have larger spatial reach and extend further outside the active population than high-frequency components. Further, the spatial LFP profiles for such populations typically span the full vertical extent of the dendrites of neurons in the population. Our numerical findings are backed up by an intuitive simplified model for the generation of population LFP.},

abstract = {Hodgkin and Huxley (H-H) model for action potential generation has held firm for half a century because this relatively simple and experimentally testable model embodies the major features of membrane nonlinearity: namely, voltage-dependent ionic currents that activate and inactivate in time. However, experimental and theoretical developments of the past 20 years force one to re-evaluate its usefulness. First, the H-H model is, in its original form, limited to the two voltage-dependent currents found in the squid giant axon and it must be extended significantly if it is to deal with the excitable soma and dendrites of neurons. Second, the macroscopic and deterministic H-H model does not capture correctly the kinetics of the Na+ channel and it cannot account for the stochastic response to current injection that arises from the discrete nature of ion channels. Third, much simpler integrate-and-fire-type models seem to be more useful for exploring collective phenomena in neuronal networks. Is the H-H model threatened, or will it continue to set the fundamental framework for exploring neuronal excitability?},

abstract = {This investigation was designed to study the effects of post-activation depression in different spinal pathways fed by group I afferents available to investigation in human subjects. It was precipitated by a recent investigation in the cat showing that-contrary to the general assumption-post-activation depression is not a widespread phenomenon in the spinal cord. In 24 healthy subjects comparison was made between the effects of low and high-test stimulus rates on the monosynaptic Ia excitation, known to be subject to post-activation depression, and on oligosynaptic pathways fed by group I afferents. Both the amplitude of monosynaptic H reflexes and the amount of heteronymous monosynaptic Ia facilitation were significantly smaller at high than at low-test stimulus rates (1-2 s compared with 6-8 s between two consecutive stimuli). So was the amount of reciprocal Ia inhibition of tibialis anterior motoneurones. In contrast, the amount of other non-monosynaptic group I effects directed to the same motor nuclei (peroneal-induced excitation of quadriceps motoneurones, disynaptic non-reciprocal group I inhibition of flexor carpi radialis motoneurones, and D1 inhibition of flexor carpi radialis and soleus H reflexes) were enhanced at high stimulus rates. Results in humans confirm that post-activation depression depends on the type of group I afferents, and/or on the target neurones. The functional significance of the discrepancy between post-activation depression in pure Ia pathways and in other group I pathways is discussed with regard to the fusimotor-driven servo-assistance from Ia afferent discharges.},

Five control strategies often discussed in the context of human motor control are examined: three time-invariant controllers [proportional-derivative, proportional-derivative-acceleration (PDA), model predictive (MP) controllers] and two time-varying controllers [act-and-wait (AAW) and intermittent predictive controllers]. The uncertainties of the sensory input are modeled as a multiplicative term in the system output. Estimates based on the variability of neural spike trains and neural population responses suggest that [Formula: see text]-13 {\%}. It is found that for this range of uncertainty, a tapped delay-line type of MP controller is the most robust controller. In particular, this controller can stabilize inverted sticks of the length balanced by expert stick balancers (0.25-0.5 m when [Formula: see text] s). However, a PDA controller becomes more effective when [Formula: see text]. A comparison between [Formula: see text] for human stick balancing at the fingertip and balancing on the rubberized surface of a table tennis racket suggest that friction likely plays a role in balance control.

abstract = {We hypothesized that post-movement beta synchronization (PMBS) and cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) during movement termination relate to each other and have similar role in sensorimotor integration. We calculated the parameters and estimated the sources of these phenomena.We measured 64-channel EEG simultaneously with surface EMG of the right first dorsal interosseus muscle in 11 healthy volunteers. In Task1, subjects kept a medium-strength contraction continuously; in Task2, superimposed on this movement, they performed repetitive self-paced short contractions. In Task3 short contractions were executed alone. Time-frequency analysis of the EEG and CMC was performed with respect to the offset of brisk movements and averaged in each subject. Sources of PMBS and CMC were also calculated.High beta power in Task1, PMBS in Task2-3, and CMC in Task1-2 could be observed in the same individual frequency bands. While beta synchronization in Task1 and PMBS in Task2-3 appeared bilateral with contralateral predominance, CMC in Task1-2 was strictly a unilateral phenomenon; their main sources did not differ contralateral to the movement in the primary sensorimotor cortex in 7 of 11 subjects in Task1, and in 6 of 9 subjects in Task2. In Task2, CMC and PMBS had the same latency but their amplitudes did not correlate with each other. In Task2, weaker PMBS source was found bilaterally within the secondary sensory cortex, while the second source of CMC was detected in the premotor cortex, contralateral to the movement. In Task3, weaker sources of PMBS could be estimated in bilateral supplementary motor cortex and in the thalamus. PMBS and CMC appear simultaneously at the end of a phasic movement possibly suggesting similar antikinetic effects, but they may be separate processes with different active functions. Whereas PMBS seems to reset the supraspinal sensorimotor network, cortico-muscular coherence may represent the recalibration of cortico-motoneuronal and spinal systems.},

abstract = {A linear relation between surface electromyogram (EMG) amplitude and muscle force is often assumed and used to estimate the contributions of selected muscles to various tasks. In the presence of muscle fatigue, however, changes in the properties of muscle fibre action potentials and motor unit twitch forces can alter the relation between surface EMG amplitude and force. A novel integrative model of motor neuron control and the generation of muscle fibre action potentials was used to simulate surface EMG signals and muscle force during three fatigue protocols. The change in the simulated relation between surface EMG amplitude and force depended on both the level of fatigue and the details of the fatiguing contraction. In general, surface EMG amplitude overestimated muscle force when fatigue was present. For example, surface EMG amplitudes corresponding to 60 per cent of the amplitude obtained at maximal force without fatigue corresponded to forces in the range 10-40{\%} of the maximal force across three representative fatigue protocols. The results indicate that the surface EMG amplitude cannot be used to predict either the level of muscle activation or the magnitude of muscle force when the muscle exhibits any fatigue.},

abstract = {The 'Hebbian synapse', an old neuro-psychological concept which describes the process of associative learning at the synaptic level, is being increasingly confirmed by neuro-biological explanations. The purpose of the present paper is to show that sensorimotor learning, which is essentially non-associative, can also be explained by Hebbian learning. This requires a redefinition of the Hebbian synapse ensuring convergence of the synaptic weight. Re-defined Hebbian learning then appears as a linear adaptive filter known in the field of adaptive signal processing, which in turn is equivalent to the delta rule used to train artificial neural networks. For motor learning, the modified Hebbian synapse must be embedded into a special learning algorithm called 'auto-imitation', This is a non goal-oriented inductive learning algorithm, enabling a controller to adopt a general rule from being shown only a Few examples of that rule. When applied to motor learning, the neural controller can acquire the capability to online invert the behavior of the plant to be controlled. The complete learning process then can be described as a relaxation process between the controller and the controlled system, which is governed by long-term potentiation (LTP), the neuro-physiological process underlying Hebbian synaptic shaping.

abstract = {Motor unit (MU) potentials were recorded from brachial biceps of healthy subjects aged 5.5-79 years. The subjects were subdivided into young (5.5-19 year) and adult (37.5-79 year) groups, between which single MU discharge characteristics were compared. Firing rates were in the ranges of 8.3-21.7 s(-1) (mean 12.87 s(-1)) and 5.9-18.7 s(-1) (mean 11.08 s(-1)) for young and adult groups, respectively. Standard deviations (s.d.) of interspike intervals (ISIs) were in the range 4.84-11.57 ms (mean 8.39 ms) for the young group and 4.26-12.23 ms (mean 7.76 ms) for the adult group. Both differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Special attention was paid to the previously developed method of ISI variability analysis, which enabled the comparison of MUs with respect to afterhyperpolarization (AHP) duration of their motoneurones (MNs). The results show that AHP duration increases gradually with increasing age, which is in line with the transformation of muscle properties towards a slower phenotype. This transformation seems to be a continuous process, covering the entire lifespan of a human being, from childhood to senescence. The results presented here are significant for their insight into the ageing process of the neuromuscular system. The age-related change in AHP duration has not been investigated previously in human studies and has been met with ambiguous results in animal studies.},

abstract = {Rapid temporal modulation of acoustic signals among several vertebrate lineages has recently been shown to depend on the actions of superfast muscles. We hypothesized that such fast events, known to require synchronous activation of muscle fibers, would rely on motoneuronal properties adapted to generating a highly synchronous output to sonic muscles. Using intracellular in vivo recordings, we identified a suite of premotor network inputs and intrinsic motoneuronal properties synchronizing the oscillatory-like, simultaneous activation of superfast muscles at high gamma frequencies in fish. Motoneurons lacked spontaneous activity, firing synchronously only at the frequency of premotor excitatory input. Population-level motoneuronal output generated a spike-like, vocal nerve volley that directly determines muscle contraction rate and, in turn, natural call frequency. In the absence of vocal output, motoneurons showed low excitability and a weak afterhyperpolarization, leading to rapid accommodation in firing rate. By contrast, vocal activity was accompanied by a prominent afterhyperpolarization, indicating a dependency on network activity. Local injection of a GABA(A) receptor antagonist demonstrated the necessity of electrophysiologically and immunohistochemically confirmed inhibitory GABAergic input for motoneuronal synchrony and vocalization. Numerous transneuronally labeled motoneurons following single-cell neurobiotin injection together with electrophysiological collision experiments confirmed gap junctional coupling, known to contribute to synchronous activity in other neural networks. Motoneuronal synchrony at the premotor input frequency was maintained during differential recruitment of variably sized motoneurons. Differential motoneuron recruitment led, however, to amplitude modulation (AM) of vocal output and, hence, natural call AM. In summary, motoneuronal intrinsic properties, in particular low excitability, predisposed vocal motoneurons to the synchronizing influences of premotor inputs to translate a temporal input code into a coincident and extremely synchronous, but variable-amplitude, output code. We propose an analogous suite of neuronal properties as a key innovation underlying similarly rapid acoustic events observed among amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.},

abstract = {It has been widely assumed for nearly a century, that postural muscles operate in a spring-like manner and that muscle length signals joint angle (the mechano-reflex mechanism). Here we employ automated analysis of ultrasound images to resolve calf muscle (soleus and gastrocnemius) length changes as small as 10 pm in standing subjects. Previously, we have used balancing of a real inverted pendulum to make predictions about human standing. Here we test and confirm these predictions on 10 subjects standing quietly. We show that on average the calf muscles are actively adjusted 2.6 times per second and 2.8 times per unidirectional sway of the body centre of mass (CoM). These alternating, small (30-300 mu m) movements provide impulsive, ballistic regulation of CoM movement. The timing and pattern of these adjustments are consistent with multisensory integration of all information regarding motion of the CoM, pattern recognition, prediction and planning using internal models and are not consistent with control solely by local reflexes. Because the system is unstable, errors in stabilization provide a perturbation which grows into a sway which has to be reacted to and corrected. Sagittal sway results from this impulsive control of calf muscle activity rather than internal sources (e.g. the heart, breathing). This process is quite unlike the mechano-reflex paradigm. We suggest that standing is a skilled, trial and error activity that improves with experience and is automated (possibly by the cerebellum). These results complement and extend our recent demonstration that paradoxical muscle movements are the norm in human standing.},

abstract = {Neuroinformatics seeks to create and maintain web-accessible databases of experimental and computational data, together with innovative software tools, essential for understanding the nervous system in its normal function and in neurological disorders. Neuroinformatics includes traditional bioinformatics of gene and protein sequences in the brain; atlases of brain anatomy and localization of genes and proteins; imaging of brain cells; brain imaging by positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and other methods; many electrophysiological recording methods; and clinical neurological data, among others. Building neuroinformatics databases and tools presents difficult challenges because they span a wide range of spatial scales and types of data stored and analyzed. Traditional bioinformatics, by comparison, focuses primarily on genomic and proteomic data (which of course also presents difficult challenges). Much of bioinformatics analysis focus on sequences (DNA, RNA, and protein molecules), as the type of data that are stored, compared, and sometimes modeled. Bioinformatics is undergoing explosive growth with the addition, for example, of databases that catalog interactions between proteins, of databases that track the evolution of genes, and of systems biology databases which contain models of all aspects of organisms. This commentary briefly reviews neuroinformatics with clarification of its relationship to traditional and modern bioinformatics.},

abstract = {In previous work it has been shown in posture experiments of the human arm that reflexive dynamics were substantial for narrow-band stochastic force disturbances. The estimated reflex gains varied substantially with the frequency content of the disturbances. The present study analyses a simplified linear model of the reflexive feedback control loop, to provide an explanation for the observed behaviour. The model describes co-activation and reflexive feedback. The task instruction 'minimize the displacements' is represented mathematically by a cost function that is minimized by adjusting the parameters of the model. Small-amplitude displacements allow the system to be analysed with a quasilinear approach. The optimization results clarify the limited effectiveness of reflexive feedback on the system's closed-loop behaviour, which emanates from the time delay present in the reflex loops. For low-frequency inputs less than 5 Hz, boundary-stable solutions with high reflex gains are predicted to be optimal. Input frequencies near the system's eigenfrequency (about 5 Hz), however, would be amplified and result in oscillatory behaviour. As long as the disturbance does not excite these frequencies, boundary stability will be optimal. The predicted reflex gains show a striking similarity with the estimated reflex gains from the experimental study. The present model analysis also provides a clear explanation for the negative reflex gains, estimated for near-sinusoidal inputs beyond 1.5 Hz.},

This study measures these plastic adaptations using several synaptic morphological parameters. The observed changes in neuromuscular junctions affect both pre-and postsynaptic membranes. In particular, the presynaptic membrane densities in the active zones and the postsynaptic adaxonal membrane densities become larger, which shows that in the normal adult mammal neuromuscular junction, there is an activity-dependent modulation of the neurotransmission-related structures in response to slight physiologic functional demands. The nature and magnitude of these changes are discussed.},

abstract = {Significant trial-by-trial variation persists even in the most practiced skills. One prevalent view is that such variation is simply 'noise' that the nervous system is unable to control or that remains below threshold for behavioural relevance. An alternative hypothesis is that such variation enables trial-and-error learning, in which the motor system generates variation and differentially retains behaviours that give rise to better outcomes. Here we test the latter possibility for adult bengalese finch song. Adult birdsong is a complex, learned motor skill that is produced in a highly stereotyped fashion from one rendition to the next. Nevertheless, there is subtle trial-by-trial variation even in stable, 'crystallized' adult song. We used a computerized system to monitor small natural variations in the pitch of targeted song elements and deliver real-time auditory disruption to a subset of those variations. Birds rapidly shifted the pitch of their vocalizations in an adaptive fashion to avoid disruption. These vocal changes were precisely restricted to the targeted features of song. Hence, birds were able to learn effectively by associating small variations in their vocal behaviour with differential outcomes. Such a process could help to maintain stable, learned song despite changes to the vocal control system arising from ageing or injury. More generally, our results suggest that residual variability in well learned skills is not entirely noise but rather reflects meaningful motor exploration that can support continuous learning and optimization of performance.},

abstract = {Posture and postural reactions to mechanical perturbations require the harmonic modulation of the activity of multiple muscles. This precision can become suboptimal in the presence of neuromuscular disorders and result in higher fall risk and associated levels of comorbidity. This study was designed to investigate neurophysiological principles related to the generation and distribution of inputs to skeletal muscles previously recognized as a synergistic group. Specifically, we investigated the current hypothesis that correlated neural inputs, as measured by intermuscular coherence, are the mechanism used by the central nervous system to coordinate the formation of postural muscle synergies. This hypothesis was investigated by analyzing the strength and distribution of correlated neural inputs to postural muscles during the execution of a quiet stance task. Nine participants, 4 females and 5 males, mean age 29.2 years old (±6.1 SD), performed the task of standing while holding a 5-kg barbell in front of their bodies at chest level. Subjects were asked to maintain a standing position for 10 s while the activity of three postural muscles was recorded by surface electrodes: soleus (SOL), biceps femoris (BF), and lumbar erector spinae (ERE). EMG–EMG coherence was estimated for three muscle pairs (SOL/BF, SOL/ERE, and BF/ERE). Our choice of studying these muscles was made based on the fact that they have been reported as components of a functional (synergistic) muscle group that emerges during the execution of bipedal stance. In addition, an isometric contraction can be easily induced in this muscle group by simply adding a weight to the body’s anterior aspect. The experimental condition elicited a significant increase in muscle activation levels for all three muscles (p < 0.01 for all muscles). EMG–EMG coherence analysis revealed significant coherence within two distinct frequency bands, 0–5 and 5–20 Hz. Significant coherence within the later frequency band was also found to be significantly uniformly distributed across the three muscle pairs. These findings are interpreted as corroborative with the idea of a hierarchic system of control where the controller may use the generation of common neural inputs to reduce the number of variables it manipulates.},

The effects of numerical integration are included in the model. Two accelerometers, with different noise ratings, are chosen for study. It is found that the theoretical model gives good quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for the variation of positional errors with integration time.

abstract = {Electrical stimulation over human muscle can generate force directly by activation of motor axons and indirectly by 'reflex' recruitment of spinal motoneurones. These experiments were designed to define the properties of the centrally generated 'reflex' force, including the optimal stimulus conditions for producing it in tibialis anterior (TA) and triceps surae (TS), and its interaction with volition. Subjects (n = 21) were seated with their foot strapped to an isometric myograph. Surface EMG was recorded from TS and TA. High-frequency electrical stimulation (100 Hz) of TS and TA with wide pulse widths (1 ms) was most effective to evoke the sustained centrally generated forces. The maximal force evoked by this mechanism during stimulation of TA for 40 s was similar to42{\%} of that produced by a maximal voluntary contraction. For both muscle groups, ramp increases and decreases in stimulus frequency (from similar to4 to 100 Hz and back to 4 Hz over 6 s) resulted in marked hysteresis in the force-frequency plot. After a single 'burst' of 100 Hz stimulation during prolonged stimulation at 25 Hz, force remained elevated. Repeated bursts often generated progressively larger force increments. These behaviours were abolished by an anaesthetic nerve block proximal to the stimulation site, confirming the central origin for the 'extra' force. After a brief voluntary contraction was performed during 25 Hz stimulation, force remained elevated, and this showed some gradation with voluntary contraction amplitude. Sometimes voluntary contractions alone initiated the sustained central motor output. Involuntary contractions often persisted for many seconds after electrical stimulation ceased. These were not terminated by brief inhibitory inputs to the active motoneurones but could be stopped by the voluntary command to 'relax completely'. Overall, these centrally generated contractions are consistent with activation of plateau potentials in motoneurones innervating the ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors. Large forces can be produced through this mechanism. The interaction with volitional drives suggests that plateau behaviour may contribute significantly to the normal output of human motoneurones.},

abstract = {In motor neuron disease, the focus of therapy is to prevent or slow neuronal degeneration with neuroprotective pharmacological agents; early diagnosis and treatment are thus essential. Incorporation of needle electromyographic evidence of lower motor neuron degeneration into diagnostic criteria has undoubtedly advanced diagnosis, but even earlier diagnosis might be possible by including tests of subclinical upper motor neuron disease. We hypothesized that beta-band (15-30 Hz) intermuscular coherence could be used as an electrophysiological marker of upper motor neuron integrity in such patients. We measured intermuscular coherence in eight patients who conformed to established diagnostic criteria for primary lateral sclerosis and six patients with progressive muscular atrophy, together with 16 age-matched controls. In the primary lateral sclerosis variant of motor neuron disease, there is selective destruction of motor cortical layer V pyramidal neurons and degeneration of the corticospinal tract, without involvement of anterior horn cells. In progressive muscular atrophy, there is selective degeneration of anterior horn cells but a normal corticospinal tract. All patients with primary lateral sclerosis had abnormal motor-evoked potentials as assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, whereas these were similar to controls in progressive muscular atrophy. Upper and lower limb intermuscular coherence was measured during a precision grip and an ankle dorsiflexion task, respectively. Significant beta-band coherence was observed in all control subjects and all patients with progressive muscular atrophy tested, but not in the patients with primary lateral sclerosis. We conclude that intermuscular coherence in the 15-30 Hz range is dependent on an intact corticospinal tract but persists in the face of selective anterior horn cell destruction. Based on the distributions of coherence values measured from patients with primary lateral sclerosis and control subjects, we estimated the likelihood that a given measurement reflects corticospinal tract degeneration. Therefore, intermuscular coherence has potential as a quantitative test of subclinical upper motor neuron involvement in motor neuron disease.},

The current view is that the influence is weak and takes place indirectly via oligosynaptic pathways. We examined possible contralateral effects from group I afferents on presynaptic inhibition of Ia terminals in humans and cats. In resting and seated human subjects the soleus (SO) H-reflex was conditioned by an electrical stimulus to the ipsilateral common peroneal nerve (CPN) to assess the level of presynaptic inhibition (PSI{\_}control). A brief conditioning vibratory stimulus was applied to the triceps surae tendon at the contralateral side (to activate preferentially Ia muscle afferents). The amplitude of the resulting H-reflex response (PSI{\_}conditioned) was compared to the H-reflex under PSI{\_}control, i.e., without the vibration. The interstimulus interval between the brief vibratory stimulus and the electrical shock to the CPN was -60 to 60 ms. The H-reflex conditioned by both stimuli did not differ from that conditioned exclusively by the ipsilateral CPN stimulation. In anesthetized cats, bilateral monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs) in the left and right L(7) ventral roots were recorded simultaneously. Conditioning stimulation applied to the contralateral group I posterior biceps and semitendinosus (PBSt) afferents at different time intervals (0-120 ms) did not have an effect on the ipsilateral gastrocnemius/soleus (GS) MSR. An additional experimental paradigm in the cat using contralateral tendon vibration, similar to that conducted in humans, was also performed. No significant differences between GS-MSRs conditioned by ipsilateral PBSt stimulus alone and those conditioned by both ipsilateral PBSt stimulus and contralateral tendon vibration were detected. The present results strongly suggest an absence of effects from contralateral group I fibers on the presynaptic mechanism of MSR modulation in relaxed humans and anesthetized cats.},

abstract = {The recovery of persistent inward currents (PICs) and motoneuron excitability after chronic spinal cord transection is mediated, in part, by the development of super-sensitivity to residual serotonin (5HT) below the lesion. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if, like 5HT, endogenous sources of norepinephrine (NE) facilitate motoneuron PICs after chronic spinal transection. Cutaneous-evoked reflex responses in tail muscles of awake chronic spinal rats were measured after increasing presynaptic release of NE by administration of amphetamine. An increase in long-lasting reflexes, known to be mediated by the calcium component of the PIC (CaPIC), was observed even at low doses (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) of amphetamine. These findings were repeated in a reduced S2 in vitro preparation, demonstrating that the increased long-lasting reflexes by amphetamine were neural. Under intracellular voltage clamp, amphetamine application led to a large facilitation of the motoneuron CaPIC. This indicates that the increases in long-lasting reflexes induced by amphetamine in the awake animal were, in part, due to actions directly on the motoneuron. Reflex responses in acutely spinal animals were facilitated by amphetamine similar to chronic animals but only at doses that were ten times greater than that required in chronic animals (0.2 mg/kg chronic vs. 2.0 mg/kg acute), pointing to a development of supersensitivity to endogenous NE in chronic animals. In summary, the increases in long-lasting reflexes and associated motoneuron CaPICs by amphetamine are likely due to an increased release of endogenous NE, which motoneurons become supersensitive to in the chronic stages of spinal cord injury.},

abstract = {Objective: Foot dorsiflexion evokes a short- (SLR) and a medium-latency ENIG response (MLR) in the soleus of standing subjects. SLR is mediated by spindle group la, while group 11 fibres contribute to MLR through an oligosynaptic circuit. We studied the effects of Achilles' tendon vibration on both responses in spastic patients to disclose any abnormal excitability of these pathways. Methods: SLR and MLR were evoked in 11 hemiparetics and 11 normals. The vibration-induced changes in both responses were correlated to the Ashworth score of the affected leg. Results: There were no differences between normals and patients in the size of control SLR or MLR. Vibration decreased SLR to 70{\%} in normal subjects, but increased it to 110{\%} in patients, in both affected and unaffected leg. Vibration did not affect MLR in normals, but increased it to 165{\%} on the affected and 120{\%} on the unaffected side of patients. Ashworth score was solely correlated with the degree of vibration-induced increase of MLR. Conclusions: While the lack of inhibitory effect of vibration on SLR confirms a reduced inhibitibility of the monosynaptic reflex, the increased NILR indicates a disinhibition of group 11 pathway in patients, connected to the loss of descending control on group 11 interneurones. Spastic hypertonia depends on release of group It rather than group la reflex pathways. Significance: These findings give a neurophysiological support for the pharmacological treatment of spastic hypertonia and suggest a method for the assessment of its effects.

abstract = {Tactile information about an object in contact with the skin surface is contained in the spatio-temporal load distribution on the skin, the corresponding stresses and strains at mechanosensitive receptor locations within the skin, and the associated pattern of electrical impulses produced by the receptor population. At present, although the responses of the receptors to known stimuli can be recorded, no experimental techniques exist to observe either the load distribution on the skin or the corresponding stress-state at the receptor locations. In this paper, the role of mechanics in the neural coding of tactile information is investigated using simple models of the primate fingertip. Four models that range in geometry from a semi-infinite medium to a cylindrical finger with a rigid bone, and composed of linear elastic media, are analyzed under plane strain conditions using the finite element method. The results show that the model geometry has a significant influence on the surface load distribution as well as the subsurface stress and strain fields for a given mechanical stimulus. The elastic medium acts like a spatial low pass filter with the property that deeper the receptor location, the more blurred the tactile information. None of the models predicted the experimentally observed surface deflection profiles under line loads as closely as a simple heterogeneous waterbed model that treated the fingerpad as a membrane enclosing an incompressible fluid (Srinivasan, 1989). This waterbed model, however, predicted a uniform state of stress inside the fingertip and thus failed to explain the spatial variations observed in the neural response. For the cylindrical model indented by rectangular gratings, the maximum compressive strain and strain energy density at typical receptor locations emerged as the two strain measures that were directly related to the electrophysiologically recorded response rate of slowly adapting type I (SAI) mechanoreceptors. Strain energy density is a better candidate to be the relevant stimulus for SAIs, since it is a scalar that is invariant with respect to receptor orientations and is a direct measure of the distortion of the receptor caused by the loads imposed on the skin.},

We discuss evidence from recent studies on top-down mechanisms involved in cognitive processing, on the motor system and on the pathophysiology of movement disorders that suggest a unifying hypothesis: beta-band activity seems related to the maintenance of the current sensorimotor or cognitive state. We hypothesize that beta oscillations and/or coupling in the beta-band are expressed more strongly if the maintenance of the status quo is intended or predicted, than if a change is expected. Moreover, we suggest that pathological enhancement of beta-band activity is likely to result in an abnormal persistence of the status quo and a deterioration of flexible behavioural and cognitive control.},

abstract = {Both contraction type and ageing may cause changes in H-reflex excitability. H reflex is partly affected by presynaptic inhibition that may also be an important factor in the control of MU activation. The purpose of the study was to examine age related changes in H-reflex excitability and motor unit activation patterns in dynamic and in isometric contractions. Ten younger (YOUNG) and 13 elderly (OLD) males performed isometric (ISO), concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) plantarflexions with submaximal activation levels (20{\%} and 40{\%} of maximal soleus surface EMG). Intramuscular EMG data was analyzed utilizing an intramuscular spike amplitude frequency histogram method. Average H/M ratio was always lowest in ECC (n.s.). Mean spike amplitude increased with activation level (P<.05), whereas no significant differences were found between contraction types. Both H-reflex excitability, which may be due to an increase in presynaptic inhibition, and mean spike frequency were higher in YOUNG compared to OLD. In OLD the mean spike frequency was significantly smaller in CON compared to ISO. Lack of difference in mean spike amplitude and frequency across contraction types in YOUNG would imply a similar activation strategy, whereas the lower frequency in dynamic contractions in OLD could be related to synergist muscle behavior.},

abstract = {Human skeletal Muscle is composed of a heterogenous collection of muscle fiber types.(1-3) This range of muscle fiber types allows for the wide variety of capabilities that human muscles display. In addition, muscle fibers can adapt to changing demands by changing size or fiber type composition. This plasticity serves as the physiologic basis for numerous physical therapy interventions designed to increase a patient's force development or endurance. Changes in fiber type composition also may be partially responsible for some of the impairments and disabilities seen in patients who are deconditioned because of prolonged inactivity, limb immobilization, or muscle denervation.(2) Over the past several decades, the number of techniques available for classifying muscle fibers has increased, resulting in several classification systems. The objective of this update is to provide the basic knowledge necessary, to read and interpret research on human skeletal muscle. Muscle fiber types can be described using histochemical, biochemical, morphological, or physiologic characteristics; however, classifications of muscle fibers by different techniques do not always agree.(1) Therefore, Muscle fibers that may be grouped together by one classification technique may be placed in different categories using a different classification technique. A basic understanding of muscle structure and physiology is necessary to understand the muscle fiber classification techniques.},

Seven subjects performed a force-matching task of isometric plantar flexion at 5{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction with and without random electrical stimulation applied to the tibial nerve. During the task, the motor unit action potential was continuously recorded with fine-wire electrodes, and the inter-spike intervals of a single motor unit were calculated. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the force fluctuations and the inter-spike intervals of the motor unit discharge were significantly decreased by the intervention of subthreshold electrical stimulation, although there were no changes in the mean values. These results suggest that subthreshold stimulation reduced the motor-unit discharge variability, which in turn, increased the steadiness of the force.},

@article{Rudomin1999,
abstract = {The present review examines the experimental evidence supporting the existence of central mechanisms able to modulate the synaptic effectiveness of sensory fibers ending in the spinal cord of vertebrates. The first section covers work on the mode of operation and the synaptic mechanisms of presynaptic inhibition, in particular of the presynaptic control involving axo-axonic synapses made by GABAergic interneurons with the terminal arborizations of the afferent fibers. This includes reviewing of the ionic mechanisms involved in the generation of primary afferent depolarization (PAD) by GABAergic synapses, the ultrastructural basis underlying the generation of PAD, the relationship between PAD and presynaptic inhibition, the conduction of action :potentials in the terminal arborizations of the afferent fibers, and the modeling of the presynaptic inhibitory synapse. The second section of the review deals with the functional organization of presynaptic inhibition. This includes the segmental and descending presynaptic control of the synaptic effectiveness of group-I and group-II muscle afferents, the evidence dealing with the local character of PAD as well as the differential inhibition of PAD in selected collaterals of individual muscle-spindle afferents by cutaneous and descending inputs. This section also examines observations on the presynaptic modulation of large cutaneous afferents, including the modulation of the synaptic effectiveness of thin myelinated and unmyelinated cutaneous fibers and of visceral afferents, as well as the presynaptic control of the synaptic actions of interneurons and descending tract neurons. The third section deals with the changes in PAD occurring during sleep and fictive locomotion in higher vertebrates and with the changes of presynaptic inhibition in humans during the execution of a variety of voluntary movements. In the final section, we examine the non-synaptic presynaptic modulation of transmitter release, including the possibility that the intraspinal endings of primary afferents also release colocalized peptides in a similar way as in the periphery. The outcome of the studies presently reviewed is that intraspinal terminals of sensory fibers are not hard-wired conductors of the information generated in their peripheral sensory receptors, but dynamic systems that convey information that can be selectively addressed by central mechanisms to specific neuronal targets. This central control of information flow in peripheral efferents appears to play an important role in the generation of integrated movements and processing of sensory information, including nociceptive information.},

abstract = {With regular trains of stimuli at a high frequency, the contribution of each stimulus to the force generated over time declines from the second to about the tenth stimulus, but then begins to increase again. This late increase is referred to as tetanic potentiation in analogy with the post-tetanic potentiation of the twitch after such a period of stimulation. With regular trains of stimuli at a low frequency, a progressive decrease in the essentially unfused twitches (negative staircase) is observed in the slow soleus muscle of the cat, while a progressive increase (positive staircase) is observed for the fast plantaris muscle. The time constant for the approximately exponential changes observed is on the order of 10 s. Random trains of stimuli were applied at intermediate frequencies and analyzed in terms of general methods of analysis for nonlinear systems. Systematic decreases in the magnitude and increases in the time course of the average tension per stimulus were observed with increasing mean rates of stimulation. Similar changes were observed for short intervals between stimuli within a given random train at a constant mean rate. These changes can be described in terms of an early depression and a later facilitation described in the previous papers in this series.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Peripheral neuropathies are one of the most common reasons for seeking neurological care in everyday practice. Electrophysi-ological studies remain fundamental for the diagnosis and etiological classification of peripheral nerve impairment. The recent technological development though of high resolution ultrasound has allowed the clinician to obtain detailed structural images of peripheral nerves. Nerve ultrasound mainly focuses on the evaluation of the cross sectional area, cross sectional area variability along the anatomical course, echogenity, vascularity and mobility of the peripheral nerves. An increase of the cross sectional area, hypervascularity, disturbed fascicular echostructure and reduced nerve mobility are some of the most common findings of entrapments neuropathies, such as the carpal or cubital tunnel syndrome. Both the cross-sectional area increase and the hyper-vascularity detected with the Doppler technique seem to correlate significantly with the clinical and electrophysiological severity of the later mononeuropathies. Significantly greater cross sectional area values of the clinically affected cervical nerve root are often detected in cases of cervical radiculopathy. In such cases, the ultrasound findings seem also to correlate significantly with disease duration. On the other hand, multifocal cross sectional area enlargement of cervical roots and/or peripheral nerves is often documented in cases of immune-mediated neuropathies. None of the later pathological ultrasound findings seem to correlate significantly with the electrophysiological parameters or the functional disability. The aim of this review is to provide a timely update on the role of neuromuscular ultrasound in the diagnostic of the most common entrapment and immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Generally the anatomy of muscles is rather complex, and the fibres have various inclination angles within the muscles. We suggest a fast and reliable way to calculate extracellular potentials produced at a point or rectangular plate electrode by a muscle fibre of finite length with an arbitrary inclination. A muscle fibre was considered to be a linear timeshift-invariant system of potential generation. Then, similar to the fibre without inclination, the extracellular potential produced by an inclined fibre was represented as the output signal of the system; it was calculated as the convolution of the input signal and impulse response. Irrespective of the inclination, the input signal of the system was the first temporal derivative of the intracellular action potential. The impulse response of the system differed for the fibres with inclination. This required a new method of analytical integration over the rectangular electrode area. The approach provides a chance to simulate and analyze motor unit potentials or F-, H- or M-responses produced by muscles of complicated anatomy (circum-pennate or complex pennate type) at electrodes of actual size and location in normals and patients with neuro-muscular disorders.

abstract = {We collected reference values of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) from healthy deltoid, brachial biceps, first dorsal interosseous, lateral vastus, and anterior tibial muscles in 105 subjects between 15 and 86 years. The MUAPs were recorded with a concentric needle electrode and extracted with a decomposition method we call multi-MUAP analysis. The main goal is to identify and extract MUAPs. Also, the firing pattern of the motor units can be followed. No significant changes with age were found for duration, spike duration, thickness, amplitude, area, size index, or number of phases in all muscles studied. We did not find any influence of gender or height. We found higher amplitudes and shorter durations compared with previous studies. This may be due to a higher contraction level that can be used with a decomposition technique. No right-left side differences were found. The coefficient of variation of the parameters in repeated examinations was small, which implies a good reliability of the measurements. Interexaminer variability of four investigators was not greater than in repeated studies. (C) 1994 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Corticomuscular coherence in the beta frequency band (15–30 Hz) has been demonstrated in both humans and monkeys, but its origin and functional role are still unclear. Phase–frequency plots produced by traditional coherence analysis are often complex. Some subjects show a clear linear phase–frequency relationship (indicative of a fixed delay) but give shorter delays than expected; others show a constant phase across frequencies. Recent evidence suggests that oscillations may be travelling around a peripheral sensorimotor loop. We recorded sensorimotor EEGs and EMGs from three intrinsic hand muscles in human subjects performing a precision grip task, and applied directed coherence (Granger causality) analysis to explore this system. Directed coherence was significant in both descending (EEG → EMG) and ascending(EMG → EEG) directions at beta frequencies. Average phase delays of 26.4 ms for the EEG → EMG direction and 29.5 ms for the EMG → EEG direction were closer to the expected conduction times for these pathways than the average delays estimated from coherence phase (7.9 ms). Subjects were sub-divided into different groups, based on the sign of the slope of the linear relation between corticomuscular coherence phase and frequency (positive, negative or zero). Analysis separated by these groups suggested that different relative magnitudes of EEG → EMG and EMG → EEG directed coherence might underlie the observed inter-individual differences in coherence phase.These results confirm the complex nature of corticomuscular coherence with contributions from both descending and ascending pathways.},

abstract = {Non-monosynaptic group I and group II excitation of human lower limb motoneurones was investigated. Changes in the firing probability of individual voluntarily activated motor units belonging to various muscles (soleus, gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, peroneus brevis, quadriceps and biceps femoris) were investigated after stimulation of various nerves (posterior tibial, common peroneal and femoral nerves) with weak (0.4-0.6xmotor threshold) electrical stimuli. In all investigated motor nuclei, stimulation of the ''homonymous'' nerve evoked a peak of increased firing probability with a latency that was 3-7 ms longer than the monosynaptic Ia latency. The more caudal the motor nucleus explored, the greater the central delay. This strongly suggests a transmission through neurones located above the lumbar enlargement. If one excepts the sural-induced excitation of peroneus brevis units, which seems to be mediated through a particular pathway, the main peripheral input to neurones mediating non-monosynaptic excitation evoked by these weak stimuli is group I in origin. The pattern of distribution of non-monosynaptic group I excitation was very diffuse, since stimulation of each nerve was able to evoke excitation in all investigated nuclei. In most cases, non-monosynaptic excitation evoked in a given motor unit by stimulation of one nerve was depressed on combined stimulation of two nerves, and evidence is presented that this lateral inhibition is exerted at a premotoneuronal level. By contrast, there was no evidence that increasing the afferent input in a given pathway evokes an ''autogenetic'' inhibition in this pathway. The negative correlation found between non-monosynaptic group I-induced and late group II-induced facilitation of the quadriceps H-reflex when using high stimulus intensities applied on the common peroneal nerve suggests that these two effects could be mediated through common interneurones.},

abstract = {To compensate for significant time delays in the control of human bipedal stance, it was suggested that a feed-forward control mechanism is needed to generate a preceding motor command to the body sway position observed in quiet standing. In this article, we present evidence that a feedback proportional-derivative (PD) controller can effectively generate a desired preceding motor command. We also discuss the following characteristics of the proposed PD controller: (1) the level of robustness of the controller with respect to neurological time delays and (2) how well the controller replicates the system's dynamics observed in experiments with able bodied subjects, i.e. how well the controller generates the observed preceding motor command. Human quiet stance was simulated using an inverted pendulum model regulated by a PD controller. The simulations were used to calculate the center of mass (COM) position and velocity data, and the motor command (ankle joint torque) data as a function of time. These data and the data obtained in the experiments were compared using cross-correlation functions (CCFs). The results presented herein imply that a PD feedback controller is capable of ensuring balance during human bipedal quiet stance, even if the neurological time delays are considerable. The proposed feedback controller can generate the preceding motor command that was observed in the experiments. Therefore, we conclude that a feed-forward mechanism is not necessary to compensate for the long closed-loop time delay in human bipedal stance as suggested in recent literature, and that the PD controller is a good approximation of the control strategy applied by able bodied subjects during quiet stance.},

abstract = {Various nonlinear regenerative responses, including plateau potentials and bistable repetitive firing modes, have been observed in motoneurons under certain conditions. Our simulation results support the hypothesis that these responses are due to plateau-generating currents in the dendrites, consistent with a major role for a noninactivating calcium L-type current as suggested by experiments. Bistability as observed in the soma of low- and higher-frequency spiking or, under TTX, of near resting and depolarized plateau potentials, occurs because the dendrites can be in a near resting or depolarized stable steady state. We formulate and study a two-compartment minimal model of a motoneuron that segregates currents for fast spiking into a soma-like compartment and currents responsible for plateau potentials into a dendrite-like compartment. Current flows between compartments through a coupling conductance, mimicking electrotonic spread. We use bifurcation techniques to illuminate how the coupling strength affects somatic behavior. We look closely at the case of weak coupling strength to gain insight into the development of bistable patterns. Robust somatic bistability depends on the electrical separation since it occurs only for weak to moderate coupling conductance. We also illustrate that hysteresis of the two spiking states is a natural consequence of the plateau behavior in the dendrite compartment.},

abstract = {The axonal projections of the internal pallidum. (GPi) in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were studied by labeling small pools of neurons with biotinylated dextran amine. Fifty-two axons were reconstructed entirely from serial sections with a camera lucida. Two types of projection neurons were identified in the GPi on the basis of their target sites. The abundant and centrally located type I neurons gave rise to a long axonal branch that descended directly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, where it arborized discretely. Other branches ascended to the thalamus and broke into 10-15 thinner collaterals that ran through most of the ventral anterior nucleus, where they terminated as typical plexuses. About half of these axons gave rise to collaterals that arborized in both components of the centre median/parafascicular thalamic complex. The less numerous and peripherally located type II neurons had an axon that climbed the rostral thalamic pole, coursed along the stria medullaris, and arborized profusely within the lateral habenular nucleus, which stood out as the most densely innervated pallidal target. Some type II axons provided collaterals to the anterior thalamic nuclei. A small proportion of axons of both types had branches that crossed the midline and terminated in contralateral GPi target structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that type I axons arborized principally along the sagittal plane. These data reveal that GPi neurons of type I act through a widely distributed axonal network upon thalamic and brainstem premotor neurons, whereas type II neurons act in a much more focused manner upon lateral habenular neurons.

abstract = {1. The soma membrane of cat spinal motoneurones was voltage clamped using separate intracellular voltage and current electrodes directed into the same motoneurone with a new guide system. 2. Antidromic stimulation of the motoneurone's axon or small depolarizing voltage clamp steps (10-20 mV from the resting potential) evoked a small (30-80 nA) all-or-none action potential current, which was shown by occlusion experiments to originate from the initial segment of the axon. Except for this axonal current spike, there was no indication of active (voltage-dependent) conductance changes in membrane regions not under good voltage clamp control. Calculations based on motoneuronal geometry, and electrophysiological recordings from spinal cord neurones in tissue culture, indicate that the proximal portions of dendritic membranes were also under good voltage clamp control. 3. Clamp depolarizations greater than 20 mV activated a fast, transient inward current, which increased in a smoothly graded manner with depolarization between 20 and 40 mV from the resting potential, reaching a peak magnitude of up to 450 nA, and then decreased smoothly for larger depolarizations. Extrapolation of the current-voltage relationship for this current indicated a reversal potential about 80-116 mV positive to the resting potential. 4. This transient inward current is blocked by tetrodotoxin. After a depolarizing voltage clamp step the conductance system controlling this current first activates with fast, non-linear kinetics, and then inactivates with first-order kinetics. These properties are similar to those of the Na conductance system in squid and frog axons. 5. Conditioning-testing experiments showed that the time constant of inactivation ranges from 1.0-1.3 msec at potentials slightly negative to the resting potential to 0.1-0.3 msec for depolarizations 60 mV from the resting potential. The degree of steady-state inactivation also varied with membrane potential, ranging from total inactivation at depolarizations greater than 30 mV from the resting potential, to minimal inactivation at potentials more than 10 mV negative to the resting potential.},

In addition to a classic sensory–motor polyneuropathy, other phenotypes of CIDP have been described including the Lewis- Sumner syndrome, distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) neuropathy, pure motor CIDP, pure sensory CIDP including chronic immune sensory polyradiculopathy (CISP), and focal CIDP. These phenotypes are currently considered to be variants of CIDP, even if the possibility that they represent different demyelinating neuropathies cannot be fully excluded considering differences in their response to therapy. Several data support the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of CIDP even if the precise targets and actors (antibodies and lymphocytes) of this immune response remain uncertain. Recent studies have shown that the therapeutic response may differ in patients with peculiar clinical presentations supporting the hypothesis that different pathogenetic mechanisms may underlie the heterogeneity of CIDP. The majority of patients with CIDP show improvement after immune therapies including corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). It remains unclear why none of the other immune therapies that were reported to be variably effective in other immune disorders proved to be effective also in CIDP.},

abstract = {We have developed a model of the human lower extremity to study how surgical changes in musculoskeletal geometry and musculotendon parameters affect muscle force and its moment about the joints. The lines of action of 43 musculotendon actuators were defined based on their anatomical relationships to three-dimensional bone surface representations. A model for each actuator was formulated to compute its isometric force-length relation. The kinematics of the lower extremity were defined by modeling the hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and metatarsophalangeal joints. Thus, the force and joint moment that each musculotendon actuator develops can be computed for any body position. The joint moments calculated with the model compare well with experimentally measured isometric joint moments. We developed a graphical interface to the model that allows the user to visualize the musculoskeletal geometry and to manipulate the model parameters to study the biomechanical consequences of orthopaedic surgical procedures. For example, tendon transfer and lengthening procedures can be simulated by adjusting the model parameters according to various surgical techniques. Results of the simulated surgeries can be analyzed quickly in terms of postsurgery muscle forces and other biomechanical variables. Just as interactive graphics have enhanced engineering design and analysis, we have found that graphics-based musculoskeletal models are effective tools for designing and analyzing surgical procedures.},

The program runs under MS-DOS and is network capable. The software structure ensures maximal flexibility for rapid changes and adaptations of the program to specific needs of a particular EEG course.

abstract = {Measuring force production in muscles is important for many applications such as gait analysis, medical rehabilitation, and human-machine interaction. Substantial research has focused on finding signal processing and modeling techniques which give accurate estimates of muscle force from the surface-recorded electromyogram (EMG). The proposed methods often do not capture both the nonlinearities and dynamic components of the EMG-force relation. In this study, parallel cascade identification (PCI) is used as a dynamic estimation tool to map surface EMG recordings from upper-arm muscles to the induced force at the wrist. PCI mapping involves generating a parallel connection of a series of linear dynamic and nonlinear static blocks. The PCI model parameters were initialized to obtain the best force prediction. A comparison between PCI and a previously published Hill-based orthogonalization scheme, that captures physiological behaviour of the muscles, has shown 44{\{}{\%}{\}} improvement in force prediction by PCI (averaged over all subjects in relative-mean-square sense). The improved performance is attributed to the structural capability of PCI to capture nonlinear dynamic effects in the generated force.},

abstract = {1. We have developed a 19-compartment cable model of a guinea pig CA3 pyramidal neuron. Each compartment is allowed to contain six active ionic conductances: g(NA), g(Ca), g(K(DR)) (where DR stands for delayed rectifier), g(K(a)), g(K(AHP)), and g(K(C)), The conductance g(Ca). is of the high-voltage activated type. The model kinetics for the first five of these conductances incorporate voltage-clamp data obtained from isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The kinetics of g(K(C)) are based on data from bullfrog sympathetic neurons. The time constant for decay of submembrane calcium derives from optical imaging of Ca signals in Purkinje cell dendrites. 2. To construct the model from available voltage-clamp data, we first reproduced current-clamp records from a model isolated neuron (soma plus proximal dendrites). We next assumed that ionic channel kinetics in the dendrites were the same as in the soma. In accord with dendritic recordings and calcium-imaging data, we also assumed that significant g(Ca) occurs in dendrites. We then attached sections of basilar and apical dendritic cable. By trial and error, we found a distribution (not necessarily unique) of ionic conductance densities that was consistent with current-clamp records from the soma and dendrites of whole neurons and from isolated apical dendrites. 3. The resulting model reproduces the Ca2+-dependent spike depolarizing afterpotential (DAP) recorded after a stimulus subthreshold for burst elicitation. 4. The model also reproduces the behavior of CA3 pyramidal neurons injected with increasing somatic depolarizing currents: low-frequency (0.3-1.0 Hz) rhythmic bursting for small currents, with burst frequency increasing with current magnitude; then more irregular bursts followed by afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) interspersed with brief bursts without AHPs; and finally, rhythmic action potentials without bursts. 5. The model predicts the existence of still another firing pattern during tonic depolarizing dendritic stimulation: brief bursts at < 1 to approximately 12 Hz, a pattern not observed during somatic stimulation. These bursts correspond to rhythmic dendritic calcium spikes. 6. The model CA3 pyramidal neuron can be made to resemble functionally a CAl pyramidal neuron by increasing gBAR(K(DR)) and decreasing dendritic gBAR(Ca) and gBAR(K(C)). Specifically, after these alterations, tonic depolarization of the soma leads to adapting repetitive firing, whereas stimulation of the distal dendrites leads to bursting. 7. A critical set of parameters concerns the regulation of the pool of intracellular [Ca2+] that interacts with membrane channels (g(K(c)) and g(K(AHP))), particularly in the dendrites. For dendritic calcium spikes to occur at approximately 12 Hz, it appears necessary to postulate a time constant of < 20 ms for decay of the intracellular [Ca2+] in this pool. 8. This revised cellular model has been incorporated into a network of neurons with mutual excitation via both quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor types. Such a model network is able to reproduce picrotoxin-induced synchronized multiple bursts. Repetitive dendritic calcium spikes appear to be crucial for the phenomenon of multiple bursts.},

abstract = {The brain's energy supply determines its information processing power, and generates functional imaging signals. The energy use on the different subcellular processes underlying neural information processing has been estimated previously for the grey matter of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. However, these estimates need reevaluating following recent work demonstrating that action potentials in mammalian neurons are much more energy efficient than was previously thought. Using this new knowledge, this paper provides revised estimates for the energy expenditure on neural computation in a simple model for the cerebral cortex and a detailed model of the cerebellar cortex. In cerebral cortex, most signaling energy (50{\{}{\%}{\}}) is used on postsynaptic glutamate receptors, 21{\{}{\%}{\}} is used on action potentials, 20{\{}{\%}{\}} on resting potentials, 5{\{}{\%}{\}} on presynaptic transmitter release, and 4{\{}{\%}{\}} on transmitter recycling. In the cerebellar cortex, excitatory neurons use 75{\{}{\%}{\}} and inhibitory neurons 25{\{}{\%}{\}} of the signaling energy, and most energy is used on information processing by non-principal neurons: Purkinje cells use only 15{\{}{\%}{\}} of the signaling energy. The majority of cerebellar signaling energy use is on the maintenance of resting potentials (54{\{}{\%}{\}}) and postsynaptic receptors (22{\{}{\%}{\}}), while action potentials account for only 17{\{}{\%}{\}} of the signaling energy use.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow {\{}{\&}{\}} Metabolism advance online publication, 21 March 2012; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2012.35.},

abstract = {In an effort to determine whether aging might alter the manner in which pairs of motor units are coactivated, the extent of motor unit synchronization was assessed in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in seven young (mean 28 years) and eight older adults (mean 75 years). During constant-force isometric contractions at either 50{\{}{\%}{\}} or 100{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximal effort, motor units were recorded using a four-wire needle electrode and a multi-channel recording technique. Customized software was utilized to identify the occurrences of motor unit action potentials from the resultant three-channel signals. The magnitude of motor unit synchronization was determined using six variables that have been described previously in the literature. The extent of motor unit synchronization was similar in both young and older adults, occurring in nearly every motor unit pair observed. During the 50{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum voluntary contractions, the CIS synchronization measure (the number of synchronized discharges per unit time) averaged 2.5 in the young subjects and 2.4 in the older individuals. The intensity of motor unit synchronization was somewhat greater during maximal force isometric contractions. We conclude that motor unit synchronization in the FDI muscle is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is not affected by the aging process.},

abstract = {Motoneurons of invertebrates and vertebrates can continue to fire repetitively after being activated by a brief, excitatory synaptic input (self-sustained firing). This firing behavior is due to the activation of intrinsic, voltage-gated currents which produce sustained regenerative depolarizations (plateau potentials) of the cell. Examination of these intrinsic cellular properties has been performed in reduced animal preparations and it is unknown ii such self-sustained firing occurs in motoneurons of the intact human. In this paper, we present evidence of this in the human by using a technique of dual motor unit recordings. Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant dorsiflexion effort, and the common synaptic input (e.g. descending drive) onto the tibialis anterior (TA) motoneuron pool was monitored by recording the firing frequency of a low threshold 'control' unit. Once the firing rate of the control unit was constant, vibration of the TA tendon recruited a second 'test' unit which continued to fire after the vibration (i.e. synaptic input) was removed, even though the firing rate of the control unit (and thus, the common drive) remained the same or decreased. Self-sustained firing of motoneurons such as this may reduce the need for prolonged synaptic input when constant muscle activation is required (e.g. for postural tone).

abstract = {Neural signals are corrupted by noise and this places limits on information processing. We review the processes involved in goal-directed movements and how neural noise and uncertainty determine aspects of our behaviour. First, noise in sensory signals limits perception. We show that, when localizing our hand, the central nervous system (CNS) integrates visual and proprioceptive information, each with different noise properties, in a way that minimizes the uncertainty in the overall estimate. Second, noise in motor commands leads to inaccurate movements. We review an optimal-control framework, known as 'task optimization in the presence of signal-dependent noise', which assumes that movements are planned so as to minimize the deleterious consequences of noise and thereby minimize inaccuracy. Third, during movement, sensory and motor signals have to be integrated to allow estimation of the body's state. Models are presented that show how these signals are optimally combined. Finally, we review how the CNS deals with noise at the neural and network levels. In all of these processes, the CNS carries out the tasks in such a way that the detrimental effects of noise are minimized. This shows that it is important to consider effects at the neural level in order to understand performance at the behavioural level.},

In cat lumbar motoneurones, disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by stimulation of antagonist motor nerves were depressed for at least 150 ms following conditioning stimulation of flexor (1.7-2 times threshold (T)) and ankle extensor (5T) nerves. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possibility that this depression is caused by presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms acting at the terminals of group I afferent fibres projecting to the Ia inhibitory interneurones and/or the terminals of these interneurones to the target motoneurones 2. Conditioning stimulation of flexor, but not ankle extensor, nerves evoked a depression of the monosynaptic Ia excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded intracellularly in Ta inhibitory interneurones. This depression lasted between 200 and 700 ms and was not accompanied by a depression of the monosynaptic EPSPs evoked by stimulation of descending pathways. These results suggest that flexor, but not ankle extensor, group I afferent fibres can modulate sensory transmission at the synapse between Ia afferent fibres and Ia inhibitory interneurones. 3. Conditioning stimulation of flexor muscle nerves, extensor muscle nerves and cutaneous nerves produced a long-lasting increase in excitability of the terminals of the Ia inhibitory interneurones. The increase in the: excitability of the terminals was not secondary to an electrotonic spread of synaptic excitation at the soma. Indeed, concomitant with the excitability increase of the terminals there were signs of synaptic inhibition in the soma. 4. The unitary IPSPs induced in target motoneurones following the spike activity of single Ia inhibitory interneurones were depressed by conditioning stimulation of muscle and cutaneous nerves. Since the conditioning stimulation also evoked compound IPSCs in those motoneurones, a firm conclusion as to whether unitary IPSP depression involved presynaptic inhibitory mechanism of the terminals of the interneurones could not be reached. 5. The possibility that the changes in excitability of the Ia interneuronal terminals reflect the presence of a presynaptic inhibitory mechanism similar to that operating at the terminals of the afferent fibres (presynaptic inhibition) is discussed.},

abstract = {In the last decade or so, there has been rapid movement toward the use of more complex stimuli in the study of perceptual function related to the hand. This review has focused on the neural mechanisms of form and texture perception. Evidence from neurophysiological and psychophysical studies in which static touch, scanning touch, and the Optacon were used indicate that the spatial acuity of the RA system may be as much as three times poorer than the SAI system, evidence that suggests that form perception is dominated by the SAI system. Pattern recognition behavior in a tactual letter recognition task appears to be directly related to the response properties of SAI afferent fibers. Psychophysical studies of roughness perception show that roughness magnitude is related to surface structure in an orderly manner. Because roughness varies along an intensive continuum, mean impulse rate in one or more of the afferent systems is the most obvious coding possibility. No satisfactory relationship between mean impulse rate and roughness has been observed, however. The strongest hypothesis is that tactual roughness perception is based on spatial variation in the SAI population response. The combined evidence from studies reviewed here suggests complementary roles for each of the afferent systems, which are presented as working hypotheses: The SAI system is the primary spatial system and is responsible for tactual form and roughness perception when the fingers contact a surface directly and for the perception of external events through the distribution of forces across the skin surface. The PC system is responsible for the perception of external events that are manifested through transmitted high-frequency vibrations of the kind that are critical in the use of objects as tools. The RA system is responsible for the detection and representation of localized movement between skin and a surface as well as for surface form and texture when surface variation is too small to activate the SAI afferents effectively.},

abstract = {1. The soleus (Sol) H reflex was conditioned by magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex at rest and during voluntary contraction in healthy human subjects. The intensity of the magnetic stimulus was adjusted so as to have no effect on the H reflex at rest. During tonic voluntary contraction the same magnetic stimulus produced a facilitation with a short latency and a long duration, thus reflecting an increased excitation of Sol motoneurones by the magnetic stimulus during voluntary contraction. 2. The amount of reflex facilitation produced by brain stimulation within the initial 0.5-1 ms after its onset was investigated at different times during dynamic ramp-and-hold plantar flexion. The facilitation was largest at the onset of voluntary activity in the Sol muscle. It then decreased abruptly within 100 ms after the onset of the voluntary contraction. Neither the voluntary Sol activity nor the control H reflex decreased at this time. 3. Electrical stimulation of the brain with the anode placed lateral to the vertex produced a facilitation of the H reflex, which preceded the facilitation evoked by magnetic stimulation by 1-2 ms. The facilitation produced by the magnetic stimulus occurred or increased at the onset of contraction in relation to rest in all experiments. However, this was the case in only two out of eight experiments, when the brain was stimulated electrically. 4. The size of the reflex facilitation measured at the onset of contraction was larger the faster the contraction. Positive correlations were found between the size of the facilitation and the peak of the first and second derivative of the torque and the peak Sol EMG activity. 5. It is suggested that the observed changes in the size of the short-latency reflex facilitation produced by magnetic brain stimulation mainly reflects changes in the excitability of corticospinal cells, since similar changes were not observed in the size of the unconditioned Sol H reflex or in the short-latency reflex facilitation produced by electrical brain stimulation. The data support the hypothesis that fast conducting corticospinal fibres with monosynaptic projections to spinal motoneurones are involved in the initiation of voluntary movement in man.},

abstract = {EMG-to-force estimation for voluntary muscle contraction has many applications in human-machine interaction, motion analysis, and rehabilitation robotics for prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons. EMG-based model can account for a subject's individual activation patterns to estimate muscle force. For the estimation, so-called Hill-type model has been used in most of the cases. It already has shown its promising performance, but it is still known as a phenomenological model considering only macroscopic physiology. We have already developed the physiological based muscle model for the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) which can render the myoelectrical property also in microscopic scale. In this paper we discuss EMG-to-force estimation based on this full physiological based muscle model in voluntary contraction. In addition to Hill macroscopic structure, a microscopic physiology originally designed by Huxley is integrated. It has significant meaning to realize the same kind of EMG-to-force estimation with a physiological based model not with a phenomenological model, because it brings the understanding of the internal biophysical dynamics and new insights about neuromuscular activations. Using same EMG data of isometric muscle contraction, the force estimation results are shown by classical approach and new physiological based approach. Its interpretation is also discussed.},

abstract = {How the intention to act results in movement is a fundamental question of brain organization. Recent work has shown that this operation involves the cooperative interaction of large neuronal populations. A population vector method, by transforming neuronal activity to the spatial domain, was used to visualize the motor cortical representation of the hand's trajectory made by rhesus monkeys as they drew spirals. Hand path was accurately reflected by a series of population vectors calculated throughout the task. A psychophysical rule relating speed to curvature, the "power law," was found in this cortical representation. The relative timing between each population vector and the corresponding portion of the movement was variable. The population vectors only preceded the movement in a predictive manner in portions of the spiral where the radius of curvature was greater than 6 centimeters. These results show that the movement trajectory is an important determinant of motor cortical activity and that this aspect of motor cortical activity may contribute only to discrete portions of the drawing movement.},

abstract = {The purposes of this study were 1) to quantify the volume of activated parts within a whole muscle and 2) to examine activated area distributions along the length of muscle. Seven male subjects performed five sets of 10 repetitions of a single-leg calf-raise exercise with the knee fully extended. Transverse relaxation time (T2)-weighted spin echo images were acquired before and immediately after the exercise. A range of pixels with a T2 greater than the mean + 1 SD of the region of interest (ROI) from the preexercise image and pixels with a T2 lower than the mean + SD of the ROI from the postexercise image were defined as "active" muscle. The active muscle images were three dimensionally reconstructed, from which the volume of the activated muscle was determined for individual triceps surae (TS) muscles. Our data indicate that similar to 46{\{}{\%}{\}} of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle was activated during the exercise, with activation of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and soleus (Sol) muscles being similar to 35{\{}{\%}{\}}. In the MG, distal portions had a greater percentage area of activated muscle than the proximal portions (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the results regarding electromyogram, activity. In contrast, regional activation differences were not observed in the LG and Sol. These findings suggest that the amounts of activated muscle and its distribution would be different among TS muscles.},

abstract = {Motor control is an area of natural science exploring how the nervous system interacts with other body parts and the environment to produce purposeful, coordinated actions. A central problem of motor control-the problem of motor redundancy-was formulated by Nikolai Bernstein as the problem of elimination of redundant degrees-of-freedom. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed using optimization methods based on a variety of cost functions. This review draws attention to a body of recent findings suggesting that the problem has been formulated incorrectly. An alternative view has been suggested as the principle of abundance, which considers the apparently redundant degrees-of-freedom as useful and even vital for many aspects of motor behavior. Over the past 10 years, dozens of publications have provided support for this view based on the ideas of synergic control, computational apparatus of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, and the equilibrium-point (referent configuration) hypothesis. In particular, large amounts of "good variance"-variance in the space of elements that has no effect on the overall performance-have been documented across a variety of natural actions. "Good variance" helps an abundant system to deal with secondary tasks and unexpected perturbations; its amount shows adaptive modulation across a variety of conditions. These data support the view that there is no problem of motor redundancy; there is bliss of motor abundance.},

The present study compares motor unit potentials (MUPs) obtained with surface EMG and macro EMG during voluntary contraction of the biceps brachii muscle of patients with enlarged MUs caused by prior poliomyelitis. Averaged surface MUPs were obtained by means of needle EMG (SMUP1) and surface EMG (SMUP2) triggering. The MUPs area and peak amplitudes correlated well when comparing the macro MUP and SMUP1 of the same MUs. When MU populations of different patients were compared, the SMUP1s and SMUP2s were equally sensitive to pathology as macro MUPs. In this, the late non-propagating positive wave (only present in unipolar recordings) is more robust than the triphasic propagating wave. Therefore, surface EMG can be used for detecting enlarged MUs. (C) 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {It is unclear if skeletal muscles act mechanically as independent actuators. The purpose of the present study was to investigate force transmission from soleus (SO) muscle for physiological lengths as well as relative positions in the intact cat hindlimb. We hypothesized that force transmission from SO fibers will be affected by length changes of its two-joint synergists. Ankle plantar flexor moment on excitation of the SO was measured for various knee angles (70-140 degrees). This involved substantial length changes of gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles. Ankle angle was kept constant (80 degrees-90 degrees). However, SO ankle moment was not significantly affected by changes in knee angle; neither were half-relaxation time and the maximal rate of relaxation (P > 0.05). Following tenotomy, SO ankle moment decreased substantially (55 +/- 16{\{}{\%}{\}}) but did not reach zero, indicating force transmission via connective tissues to the Achilles tendon (i.e., epimuscular myofascial force transmission). During contraction SO muscle shortened to a much greater extent than in the intact case (16.0 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm), which resulted in a major position shift relative to its synergists. If the SO was moved back to its position corresponding to the intact condition, SO ankle moment approached zero, and most muscle force was exerted at the distal SO tendon. Our results also suggested that in vivo the lumped intact tissues linking SO to its synergists are slack or are operating on the toe region of the stress-strain curve. Thus, within the experimental conditions of the present study, the intact cat soleus muscle appears to act mechanically as an independent actuator.},

@article{Powers1993,
abstract = {1. A ''threshold-crossing'' motoneuron model was developed to relate recently described biophysical features of cat alpha-motoneurons to motoneuron discharge behavior. This model incorporated three features not included in precedent models: 1) a low-threshold, persistent calcium current; 2) realistic voltage dependencies of the major ionic conductances; and 3) a variable spike threshold. The effects of these additional biophysical features on model behavior were investigated by successively adding them to a fixed threshold model with a single potassium conductance. 2. Fixed-threshold models with either one or two potassium conductances could not produce appropriate discharge behavior. Steady-state frequency-current (F-I) relations were characterized by a continuously increasing slope, unlike the piecewise linear relations observed in real motoneurons. These models also produced unrealistically high discharge rates at the highest levels of ''injected'' current. 3. The addition of a variable spike threshold, which was made to increase linearly with the magnitude of injected current, could limit maximum discharge rates to more realistic levels. However, steady-state F-I relations still did not exhibit the appropriate shape. 4. The incorporation of a low-threshold calcium current led to a good quantitative agreement between the steady-state F-I relations produced by the model and those obtained in real motoneurons. In addition, the steady-state relation between total membrane current and membrane voltage (I-V relation) of the model was very similar to those measured in real motoneurons. The model's I- V and F-I relations were both very sensitive to the exact form of the steady-state relation between the magnitude of the calcium conductance and membrane voltage. 5. Additional modifications, which included a second calcium conductance and a factor relating spike threshold to membrane voltage, helped to produce more realistic afterhyperpolarizations and first-interval F-I relations. 6. Bistable discharge behavior could be produced by reducing the slow potassium conductance and increasing the time constants governing the activation and deactivation of the low-threshold calcium conductance. 7. The final model thus reproduces a wide range of motoneuron behaviors including subthreshold rectification, piecewise linear first interval and steady-state F-I relations, and, with appropriate modifications, bistable discharge behavior. Nonetheless, by simplifying the representation of fast spike conductances as well as the kinetics of the other ionic conductances, the model remains simple enough to be incorporated into a larger neural network.},

abstract = {Axonal swellings are almost universal in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Concussions and traumatic brain injuries can also produce cognitive and behavioral deficits by compromising neuronal morphology. Using a spike metric analysis, we characterize computationally the effects of such axonal varicosities on spike train propagation by comparing Poisson spike train classes before and after propagation through a prototypical axonal enlargement, or focused axonal swelling. Misclassification of spike train classes and low-pass filtering of firing rate activity increases with more pronounced axonal injury. We show that confusion matrices and a calculation of the loss of transmitted information provide a very practical way to characterize how injured neurons compromise the signal processing and faithful conductance of spike trains. The method demonstrates that (i) neural codes encoded with low firing rates are more robust to injury than those encoded with high firing rates, (ii) classification depends upon the length of the spike train used to encode information, and (iii) axonal injuries reduce the variance of spike trains within a given stimulus class. The work introduces a novel theoretical and computational framework to quantify the interplay between electrophysiological dynamics with focused axonal swellings generated by injury or other neurodegenerative processes. It further suggests how pharmacology and plasticity may play a role in recovery of neural computation. Ultimately, the work bridges vast experimental observations of in vitro morphological pathologies with post-traumatic cognitive and behavioral dysfunction.},

abstract = {We analyzed the magnitude and interneuronal correlation of the variability in the activity of single neurons that were recorded simultaneously using a multielectrode array in the primary motor cortex and parietal areas 2/5 in rhesus monkeys. The animals were trained to move their arms in one of eight directions as instructed by a visual target. The relationship between variability (SD) and mean of the discharge rate was described by a power function with a similar exponent ( approximately 0.57), regardless of the cortical area or the behavioral condition. We examined whether the deviation from mean activity between target onset and the end of the movement was correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with variability in activity during the hold period before target onset. In both cortical areas, for about a quarter of the neurons, the neuronal noise of these two periods was positively correlated, whereas significant negative correlations were seldom observed. Overall, neurons with higher signal correlation (i.e., similar directional pattern) showed higher noise correlation in both cortical areas. On the other hand, when the data were divided according to the distance between the electrode tips from which the neurons were recorded, a consistent relationship between the signal and noise correlations was found only for pairs of neurons recorded through the same electrode. These results suggest that nearby neurons with similar directional tuning carry primarily redundant messages, whereas neurons in separate cortical columns perform more independent processing.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to record the discharge characteristics of tibialis anterior motor units over a range of target forces and to import these data, along with previously reported observations, into a computational model to compare experimental and simulated measures of torque variability during isometric contractions with the dorsiflexor muscles. The discharge characteristics of 44 motor units were quantified during brief isometric contractions at torques that ranged from recruitment threshold to an average of 22 ± 14.4{\{}{\%}{\}} maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque above recruitment threshold. The minimal [range: 5.8-19.8 pulses per second (pps)] and peak (range: 8.6-37.5 pps) discharge rates of motor units were positively related to the recruitment threshold torque (R(2) ≥ 0.266; P < 0.001). The coefficient of variation for interspike interval at recruitment was positively associated with recruitment threshold torque (R(2) = 0.443; P < 0.001) and either decreased exponentially or remained constant as target torque increased above recruitment threshold torque. The variability in the simulated torque did not differ from the experimental values once the recruitment range was set to ∼85{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC torque, and the association between motor twitch contraction times and peak twitch torque was defined as a weak linear association (R(2) = 0.096; P < 0.001). These results indicate that the steadiness of isometric contractions performed with the dorsiflexor muscle depended more on the distributions of mechanical properties than discharge properties across the population of motor units in the tibialis anterior.},

abstract = {Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) estimation is a frequency domain method used to detect a linear coupling between rhythmic activity recorded from sensorimotor cortex (EEG or MEG) and the electromyogram (EMG) of active muscles. In motor neuroscience, rectification of the surface EMG is a common pre-processing step prior to calculating CMC, intended to maximize information about action potential timing, whilst suppressing information relating to motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape. Rectification is believed to produce a general shift in the EMG spectrum towards lower frequencies, including those around the mean motor unit discharge rate. However, there are no published data to support the claim that EMG rectification enhances the detection of CMC. Furthermore, performing coherence analysis after the non-linear procedure of rectification, which results in a significant distortion of the EMG spectrum, is considered fundamentally flawed in engineering and digital signal processing. We calculated CMC between sensorimotor cortex EEG and EMG of two hand muscles during a key grip task in 14 healthy subjects. CMC calculated using unrectified and rectified EMG was compared. The use of rectified EMG did not enhance the detection of CMC, nor was there any evidence that MUAP shape information had an adverse effect on the CMC estimation. EMG rectification had inconsistent effects on the power and coherence spectra and obscured the detection of CMC in some cases. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, which, along with our empirical data, demonstrates that rectification is neither necessary nor appropriate in the calculation of CMC.},

@article{Hultborn1996,
abstract = {It was demonstrated that the soleus H-reflex was depressed for more than 10 s following a preceding passive dorsiflexion of the ankle joint. This depression was caused by activation of large-diameter afferents with receptors located in the leg muscles, as an ischaemic block of large-diameter fibres just below the knee joint abolished the depression, whereas a similar block just proximal to the ankle joint was ineffective. The depression of the H-reflex was not caused by changes in motoneuronal excitability, as motor-evoked potentials by magnetic brain stimulation were not depressed by the same passive dorsiflexion. Therefore it was concluded that the long-lasting depression is due to mechanisms acting at presynaptic level. The transmission of the monosynaptic Ia excitation from the femoral nerve to soleus motoneurones was not depressed by the ankle dorsiflexion. The depression thus seems to be confined to those afferents that were activated by the conditioning dorsiflexion. In parallel experiments on decerebrate cats, more invasive methods have complemented the indirect techniques used in the experiments on human subjects. A similar long-lasting depression of triceps surae monosynaptic reflexes was evoked by a preceding conditioning stimulation of the triceps surae Ia afferents. This depression was accompanied by a reduction of the monosynaptic Ia excitatory postsynaptic potential recorded intracellularly in triceps surae motoneurones, but not by changes in the input resistance or membrane potential in the motoneurones. Stimulation of separate branches within the triceps surae nerve demonstrated that the depression is confined to those afferents that were activated by the conditioning stimulus. This long-lasting depression was not accompanied by a dorsal root potential. It is concluded that the long-lasting depression is probably caused by a presynaptic effect, but different from the "classical" GABAergic presynaptic inhibition which is widely distributed among afferent fibres and accompanied by dorsal root potentials. It is more probably related to the phenomenon of a reduced transmitter release from previously activated fibres, i.e. a homosynaptic post-activation depression. The consequences of this post-activation depression for the interpretation of results on spinal mechanisms during voluntary movements in man are discussed.},

@article{Magalhaes2013a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-frequency trains of electrical stimulation applied over the human muscles can generate forces higher than would be expected by direct activation of motor axons, as evidenced by an unexpected relation between the stimuli and the evoked contractions, originating what has been called "extra forces". This phenomenon has been thought to reflect nonlinear input/output neural properties such as plateau potential activation in motoneurons. However, more recent evidence has indicated that extra forces generated during electrical stimulation are mediated primarily, if not exclusively, by an intrinsic muscle property, and not from a central mechanism as previously thought. Given the inherent differences between electrical and vibratory stimuli, this study aimed to investigate: (a) whether the generation of vibration-induced muscle forces results in an unexpected relation between the stimuli and the evoked contractions (i.e. extra forces generation) and (b) whether these extra forces are accompanied by signs of a centrally-mediated mechanism or whether intrinsic muscle properties are the predominant mechanisms.

METHODS: Six subjects had their Achilles tendon stimulated by 100 Hz vibratory stimuli that linearly increased in amplitude (with a peak-to-peak displacement varying from 0 to 5 mm) for 10 seconds and then linearly decreased to zero for the next 10 seconds. As a measure of motoneuron excitability taken at different times during the vibratory stimulation, short-latency compound muscle action potentials (V/F-waves) were recorded in the soleus muscle in response to supramaximal nerve stimulation.

RESULTS: Plantar flexion torque and soleus V/F-wave amplitudes were increased in the second half of the stimulation in comparison with the first half.

CONCLUSION: The present findings provide evidence that vibratory stimuli may trigger a centrally-mediated mechanism that contributes to the generation of extra torques. The vibration-induced increased motoneuron excitability (leading to increased torque generation) presumably activates spinal motoneurons following the size principle, which is a desirable feature for stimulation paradigms involved in rehabilitation programs and exercise training.},

abstract = {Existing current based models that capture spike activity, though useful in studying information processing capabilities of neurons, fail to throw light on their internal functioning. It is imperative to develop a model that captures the spike train of a neuron as a function of its intracellular parameters for non-invasive diagnosis of diseased neurons. This is the first ever article to present such an integrated model that quantifies the inter-dependency between spike activity and intracellular energetics. The generated spike trains from our integrated model will throw greater light on the intracellular energetics than existing current models. Now, an abnormality in the spike of a diseased neuron can be linked and hence effectively analyzed at the energetics level. The spectral analysis of the generated spike trains in a time-frequency domain will help identify abnormalities in the internals of a neuron. As a case study, the parameters of our model are tuned for Alzheimer's disease and its resultant spike trains are studied and presented. This massive initiative ultimately aims to encompass the entire molecular signaling pathways of the neuronal bioenergetics linking it to the voltage spike initiation and propagation; due to the lack of experimental data quantifying the inter dependencies among the parameters, the model at this stage adopts a particular level of functionality and is shown as an approach to study and perform disease modeling at the spike train and the mitochondrial bioenergetics level.},

abstract = {1. In standing subjects, toe-down rotation of a supporting platform elicits a medium-latency response (MLR) in tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and a long-latency response (LLR) in soleus (Sol). Toe-up rotation induces a short-latency response (SLR) in Sol and a LLR in TA. When subjects steadily hold onto a stable frame, all responses are decreased, except Sol SLR. The aim of this investigation was to assess whether the response modulation is dependent on information from the hand touching the frame, or whether it anticipates the holding task. 2. The time course of the changes in response amplitude was studied in a time interval centred around the act of holding, performed in a reaction-time mode. Subjects kept their extended arm close to the frame in front of them and brought the hand in contact with the frame in response to a visual go-signal. The platform was moved at different intervals prior to or after the go-signal. Surface EMGs of Sol, TA and deltoid (Delt) were recorded. 3. TA MLR began to decrease when the platform was displaced at an interval of 140 ms after the go-signal, about 200 ms before subjects touched the frame and 120 ms before termination of Delt EMG. Four hundred milliseconds after the go-signal the response reached and maintained maximal inhibition, similar to that occurring under the stationary holding condition. The time course of inhibition of Sol LLR and TA LLR was similar to that of TA MLR, except that LLRs began to decrease at an earlier interval. Due to the different response latency fr om the onset of the perturbations, the beginning of inhibition of both MLRs and LLRs occurred almost simultaneously. 4. The changes in amplitude of leg muscle responses are not triggered by the go-signal, contact with the frame, or arm motion, suggesting that the modulation is related to the transition to a new, stabilized postural 'set'. The similar extent and parallel time course of MLR and LLR suppression, possibly transmitted through different pathways, points to the spinal cord as the site of action. The lack of depression of the monosynaptic SLR suggests an effect at premotoneuronal level. On the basis of selectivity, latency and time course of the effect, we favour the hypothesis that a monoaminergic pathway from the brainstem is involved.},

To evaluate how reliably the average spike rate of a group of cortical neurons can represent a time-varying signal, we simulated an ensemble with realistic spike discharge behavior. We found that weak interneuronal correlation, or synchrony, allows the variability in spike rates of individual neurons to compromise the ensemble representation of time-varying signals. Brief cycles of sinusoidal modulation at frequencies above 115 Hz could not be represented by an ensemble of hundreds of neurons whose interneuronal correlation mimics that of the visual cortex. The spike variability and correlation assumed in our simulations are likely to apply to many areas of cortex and therefore may constrain the fidelity of neural computations underlying higher brain function.},

abstract = {The effect of age on latency and amplitude of leg muscle responses to stance perturbations was studied in 75 control subjects. They stood upright on a platform and were displaced by toe-up (upward tilt) and toe-down (downward tilt) platform rotations. Perturbations were induced during free and supported stance (holding on to a stable structure). Surface electromyograms (EMG) of the soleus (Sol) and tibialis anterior (TA) were recorded and latency and area of responses were measured. Body sway variables during stance with open or closed eyes were also recorded. Upward tilt evoked a short-latency response (SLR) in Sol and a long-latency response (LLR) in TA. Downward tilt evoked a medium-latency response (MLR) in TA and a LLR in Sol. This pattern of EMG responses was similar in both young and elderly subjects, although there were some differences in latency and amplitude. There was a significant relationship between latency of all responses and age. Slope of the regression lines of TA LLR, TA MLR, and Sol LLR was steeper than that of Sol SLR. Area of Sol SLR was unrelated to age, but a positive trend was identified in the other responses, significant for TA LLR. Under supported-stance condition, amplitude of TA MLR, TA LLR, and Sol LLR was decreased to a similar extent in both young and elderly subjects. There was a weak relationship between age and most body sway variables. A significant relationship was found between most sway variables and latency of Sol SLR and LLR, chiefly with eyes closed. Neither TA MLR nor LLR were significantly correlated with sway variables, but a trend was present for TA MLR with eyes closed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Fifteen patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease and 46 normal controls were studied. In the patients, leg muscle strength, touch-pressure, vibration and joint position sense were reduced; lower limb tendon reflexes were absent in 12 or markedly decreased. Motor and sensory conduction velocity (CV) of leg nerves was either reduced or not measurable. The Neurological Disability Score and the Neuropathy Score were obtained from clinical and electrophysiological examination, respectively. Tilt of a supporting platform elicited short- (SLR) and medium-latency (MLR) responses to stretch in the foot muscle flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) in controls. In the patients, the former response was absent and the latter delayed. These findings are in keeping with the known loss of large-diameter myelinated fibres, with relative sparing of the smaller fibres. The MLR delay was fully accounted for by the slowed CV of the motor fibres. The MLR afferent time was similar to that in normal subjects. Body sway area (SA) during quiet stance was recorded with eyes open or closed, and with feet apart or together. Under all postural and visual conditions, SA was within normal range in the less severely affected patients, but was moderately increased in the patients with a more severe neuropathy score. Across all patients, no correlation was found between SA and muscle force, motor CV, touch pressure, vibration and joint position sense, considered either separately or as an aggregate. We suggest that: (1) functional integrity of the largest afferent fibres is not necessary for appropriate equilibrium control during quiet stance and (2) any unsteadiness is related to additional functional alterations in smaller fibres, most likely group II spindle afferent fibres.},

First published April 20, 2006; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol. 00871.2005. -Electrical stimulation (1-ms pulses, 100 Hz) produces more torque than expected from motor axon activation (extra contractions). This experiment investigates the most effective method of delivering this stimulation for neuromuscular electrical stimulation. Surface stimulation (1-ms pulses; 20 Hz for 2 s, 100 Hz for 2 s, 20 Hz for 3 s) was delivered to triceps surae and wrist flexors (muscle stimulation) and to median and tibial nerves (nerve stimulation) at two intensities. Contractions were evaluated for amplitude, consistency, and stability. Surface electromyograph was collected to assess how H-reflexes and M-waves contribute. In the triceps surae, muscle stimulation produced the largest absolute contractions (23{\%} maximal voluntary contraction), evoked the largest extra contractions as torque increased by 412{\%} after the 100-Hz stimulation, and was more consistent and stable compared with tibial nerve stimulation. Absolute and extra contraction amplitude, consistency, and stability of evoked wrist flexor torques were similar between stimulation types: torques reached 11{\%} maximal voluntary contraction, and extra contractions increased torque by 161{\%}. Extra contractions were 10 times larger in plantar flexors compared with wrist flexors with muscle stimulation but were similar with nerve stimulation. For triceps surae, H reflexes were 3.4 times larger than M waves during nerve stimulation, yet M waves were 15 times larger than H reflexes during muscle stimulation. M waves in the wrist flexors were larger than H reflexes during nerve (8.5 times) and muscle (18.5 times) stimulation. This is an initial step toward utilizing extra contractions for neuromuscular electrical stimulation and the first to demonstrate their presence in the wrist flexors.},

abstract = {Following tetanic afferent stimulation of a monosynaptic reflex pathway, the transmission through that pathway of isolated reflex volleys is enhanced for some minutes. Post-tetanic potentiation is comparable in the monosynaptic reflex arcs of flexor and extensor muscles. The facilitator and inhibitor actions of monosynaptic reflex afferent fibers, as well as the transmitter action, are potentiated following tetanization. Little post-tetanic change attends reflex transmission through plurisynaptic reflex arcs. Various tests for excitability change made independently of the tetanized afferent fibers reveal none or a slight depression. Hence the potentiating influence of a tetanus is limited to subsequent action on the part of the recently tetanized fibers themselves. Increase in the size of the individual impulses comprising an afferent volley such as might occur during positive after-potential, would accommodate the requirement for a limited process and provide for increased synaptic action. The proposed association between post-tetanic potentiation and positive after-potential (i.e. hyperpolarization) is supported by the following lines of evidence:- 1. Changes in intensity and duration of potentiation with change in frequency and duration of tetanic stimulation are characteristic of, and parallel to, the changes of positive after-potential in similar circumstances. 2. Afferent impulses are increased following a tetanus, and in a fashion that parallels the course of monosynaptic reflex potentiation. Post-tetanic potentiation, as here described, and after-discharge, whatever may be its mechanism, are unrelated phenomena.},

@article{Shemmell2010,
abstract = {The often studied stretch reflex is fundamental to the involuntary control of posture and movement. Nevertheless, there remains controversy regarding its functional role. Many studies have demonstrated that stretch reflexes can be modulated in a task appropriate manner. This review focuses on modulation of the long-latency stretch reflex, thought to be mediated, at least in part, by supraspinal pathways. For example, this component of the stretch reflex increases in magnitude during interactions with compliant environments, relative to its sensitivity during interactions with rigid environments. This suggests that reflex sensitivity increases to augment limb stability when that stability is not provided by the environment. However, not all results support the stabilizing role of stretch reflexes. Some studies have demonstrated that involuntary responses within the time period corresponding to the long-latency reflex can destabilize limb posture. We propose that this debate stems from the fact that multiple perturbation-sensitive pathways can contribute to the long-latency stretch reflex and that these pathways have separate functional roles. The presented studies suggest that neural activity occurring within the period normally ascribed to the long-latency stretch reflex is highly adaptable to current task demands and possibly should be considered more intelligent than "reflexive".

abstract = {Earlier studies in multifunctional muscles such as the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) have demonstrated that the selection and control of motor units (MUs) can vary as a function of generated force direction. While directionally dependent motor unit recruitment and rate properties imply that there may also be differential mechanical action, this has yet to be directly demonstrated. Our objective was to determine whether there exists a range of force vectors from different motor units in the FDI muscle within individual subjects. We utilized the spike-triggered averaging (STA) method to derive force twitch estimates from single motor units. We derived MU twitch direction from the ratio of individual twitch estimates recorded concurrently from the load cell. Fifteen units from 2 subjects were used to determine MU force vectors. We were able to estimate force twitch vectors from 7-8 different MUs in each subject. The results of our study suggest that there is varied mechanical action of motor units in the FDI. It is thus possible that differential activation of individual MUs in the FDI is a function of varied mechanical action.},

@article{Shadmehr1992,
abstract = {Feldman (1966) has proposed that a muscle endowed with its spinal reflex system behaves as a non-linear spring with an adjustable resting length. In contrast, because of the length-tension properties of muscles, many researchers have modeled them as non-linear springs with adjustable stiffness. Here we test the merits of each approach: Initially, it is proven that the adjustable stiffness model predicts that isometric muscle force and stiffness are linearly related. We show that this prediction is not supported by data on the static stiffness-force characteristics of reflexive muscles, where stiffness grows non-linearly with force. Therefore, an intact muscle-reflex system does not behave as a non-linear spring with an adjustable stiffness. However, when the same muscle is devoid of its reflexes, the data shows that stiffness grows linearly with force. We aim to understand the functional advantage of the non-linear stiffness-force relationship present in the reflexive muscle. Control of an inverted pendulum with a pair of antagonist muscles is considered. Using an active-state muscle model we describe force development in an areflexive muscle. From the data on the relationship of stiffness and force in the intact muscle we derive the length-tension properties of a reflexive muscle. It is shown that a muscle under the control of its spinal reflexes resembles a non-linear spring with an adjustable resting length. This provides independent evidence in support of the Feldman hypothesis of an adjustable resting length as the control parameter of a reflexive muscle, but it disagrees with his particular formulation. In order to maintain stability of the single joint system, we prove that a necessary condition is that muscle stiffness must grow at least linearly with force at isometric conditions. This shows that co-contraction of antagonist muscles may actually destabilize the limb if the slope of this stiffness-force relationship is less than an amount specified by the change in the moment arm of the muscle as a function of joint configuration. In a reflexive muscle where stiffness grows faster than linearly with force, co-contraction will always lead to an increase in stiffness. Furthermore, with the reflexive muscles, the same level of joint stiffness can be produced by much smaller muscle forces because of the non-linear stiffness-force relationship. This allows the joint to remain stable at a fraction of the metabolic energy cost associated with maintaining stability with areflexive muscles.},

In contrast, during strong contractions, EEG power in the gamma band increased and was partly correlated with the Piper rhythm in the electromyogram. Our results show that the multiple oscillatory activities in the cortex are correlated with the force level in different ways.

abstract = {Using the ankle musculature, subjects balanced a large inverted pendulum. The equilibrium of the pendulum is unstable and quasi-regular sway was observed like that in quiet standing. Two main questions were addressed. Can subjects systematically change sway size in response to instruction and availability of visual feedback? If so, do subjects decrease sway size by increasing ankle impedance or by some alternative mechanism? The position of the pendulum, the torque generated at each ankle and the soleus and tibialis anterior EMG were recorded. Results showed that subjects could significantly reduce the mean sway size of the pendulum by giving full attention to that goal. With visual feedback sway size could be minimised significantly more than without visual feedback. In changing sway size, the frequency of the sways was not changed. Results also revealed that ankle impedance and muscle co-contraction were not significantly changed when the sway size was decreased. As the ankle impedance and sway frequency do not change when the sway size is decreased, this implies no change in ankle stiffness or viscosity. Increasing ankle impedance, stiffness or viscosity are not the only methods by which sway size could be reduced. A reduction in torque noise or torque inaccuracy via a predictive process which provides active damping could reduce sway size without changing ankle impedance and is plausible given the data. Such a strategy involving motion recognition and generation of an accurate motor response may require higher levels of control than changing ankle impedance by altering reflex or feedforward gain.},

In human subjects with higher corticomuscular coherence, prominent grouped discharge associated with a significant silent period was observed in electromyographic (EMG) signals. We examined the potential effects of beta-band corticomuscular coupling on new ballistic movement as assessed by reaction time (RT). First, we quantified the coherence between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals over the sensorimotor cortex and rectified EMG signals from the tibialis anterior muscle during tonic isometric voluntary dorsiflexion at 30{\%} of maximal effort in 15 healthy subjects. Subjects were divided into 2 groups [i.e., those with significant EEG-EMG coherence (COH+, n = 8) and those with no significant coherence (COH-, n = 7)]. Next, subjects performed ballistic contractions from a preliminary state of sustained contractions in reaction to auditory signals. RT was defined as the interval between the signal and the response onset measured by force. There were no intersubject differences in RT between COH+ and COH-. However, when the trials performed by COH+ subjects were divided into 2 groups depending on whether clear grouped discharge in the beta-band was observed in the EMG (GD+ or GD-) just prior to the reaction, RT was significantly longer in the GD+ than in the GD- trials. We found that the magnitude of EEG-EMG coherence just before the reaction was significantly greater in the GD+ than in the GD- trials. These results suggest that generation of a new movement is delayed when corticomuscular coupling is elevated.},

abstract = {EMG-driven models can be used to estimate muscle force in biomechanical systems. Collected and processed EMG readings are used as the input of a dynamic system, which is integrated numerically. This approach requires the definition of a reasonably large set of parameters. Some of these vary widely among subjects, and slight inaccuracies in such parameters can lead to large model output errors. One of these parameters is the maximum voluntary contraction force (F(om)). This paper proposes an approach to find F(om) by estimating muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) using ultrasound (US), which is multiplied by a realistic value of maximum muscle specific tension. Ultrasound is used to measure muscle thickness, which allows for the determination of muscle volume through regression equations. Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis PCSAs are estimated using published volume proportions among leg muscles, which also requires measurements of muscle fiber length and pennation angle by US. F(om) obtained by this approach and from data widely cited in the literature was used to comparatively test a Hill-type EMG-driven model of the ankle joint. The model uses 3 EMGs (Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis) as inputs with joint torque as the output. The EMG signals were obtained in a series of experiments carried out with 8 adult male subjects, who performed an isometric contraction protocol consisting of 10s step contractions at 20{\{}{\%}{\}} and 60{\{}{\%}{\}} of the maximum voluntary contraction level. Isometric torque was simultaneously collected using a dynamometer. A statistically significant reduction in the root mean square error was observed when US-obtained F(om) was used, as compared to F(om) from the literature.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model of the human lower limb that uses the electromyo-graphic (EMG) signals from 16 muscles to estimate forces generated by 34 musculotendon actuators and the resulting joint moments at the hip, knee and ankle joints during varied contractile conditions. Our proposed methodology allows overcoming limitations on force computation shown by currently available NMS models, which constrain the operation of muscles to satisfy joint moments about one single degree of freedom (DOF) only (i.e. knee flexion-extension). The design of advanced human machine interfaces can benefit from the application of our proposed multi-DOF NMS model. The better estimates of the human internal state it provides with respect to single-DOF NMS models, will allow designing more intuitive human-machine interfaces for the simultaneous EMG-driven actuation of multiple joints in lower limb powered orthoses.},

abstract = {In this study a new methodology to quantify reflexive feedback gains from the mechanical behavior of the human arm during posture maintenance is proposed. Disturbance experiments were carried out on human subjects using continuous random force inputs. The task instruction was 'minimize displacements', prescribing a maximum performance task. For the separation of intrinsic and reflexive components, system identification in the frequency domain is applied. From the time records of position and force, frequency response functions (FRFs) are estimated. Given a model structure and an appropriate estimate of the intrinsic component, an estimate of the reflex gains for length and velocity are obtained from the FRFs. The feedback gains vary considerably with the frequency content of the disturbance signal. The results show that reflexive dynamics are substantial for narrow-band and especially low-frequency input signals. It is likely that high reflex gains are most effective for low-frequency inputs (< 3 Hz) that do not excite the closed-loop system's eigenfrequency. Also significant negative reflex gains are estimated for near-sinusoidal inputs (> 1.5 Hz). It is concluded that this new methodology can offer interesting insights into the ability of the central nervous system to modulate reflexive feedback gains.},

abstract = {Toe-up or toe-down tilts of a platform on which a subject stands induce early EMG responses in the leg muscles initially stretched by the perturbation and late responses in the antagonist muscles. Early responses are thought to be connected with the stretch of the leg muscle in which they appear. Disagreement exists as to the origin of the late responses occurring in the antagonist muscle. The aims of this study were to assess (1) whether the late responses are induced by afferent volleys from the spindles of the muscle stretched by the initial perturbation, or (2) whether they are connected with the induced overall postural imbalance, and (3) whether the postural set may influence the occurrence of the late responses. Subjects standing on a platform underwent randomized perturbations stretching the soleus (Sol) muscle (upward tilts and backward translations) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles (downward tilts and forward translations). The platform movement was regulated in order to yield changes in ankle angle of similar extent and velocity during both tilt and translation. Surface EMGs of Sol and TA were recorded bilaterally. An optoelectronic device detected the movements of markers fixed on the body. From these data, movements of the head, and changes in hip, knee and ankle angles, along with variations in the length of Sol, gastrocnemii (Gas) and TA were computed. Both tilts and translations, equally stretching Sol or TA, induced similar early responses in the stretched muscle. Consistent late responses in the antagonist muscle (antagonist reactions, ARs) were induced only by tilts. In spite of similar changes in ankle angles, the most striking differences in body movements between tilts and translations stretching the same leg muscle concerned changes in knee angles and Gas length. Slight differences were also seen in vertical head movements. Standing and holding onto a frame strongly decreased the amplitude and the frequency of occurrence of both early responses and ARs only in the TA muscle, while all Sol responses were not affected. This modulation of TA responses occurred in spite of changes in ankle angle and head movements similar to those occurring under the free-standing condition. It was concluded that early EMG responses are connected with the stretch of the muscle induced by the platform movement. The ARs, on the other hand, appear to be related to the type of overall postural imbalance. The absence of ARs during translations suggests a role in these responses of the afferences from the joint and muscles of the lower limb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The innervation pattern and fascicular anatomy of muscles of different lengths in mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, macaque monkey and human legs were analyzed. Neuromuscular junctions, muscle tendon junctions and ends of intrafascicularly terminating fibers were stained for acetylcholinesterase, and fascicle lengths measured. A high correlation between increasing fascicle length and increasing number of neuromuscular junctions was found, with non-primate (mouse, guinea pig, rabbit) and primate (macaque monkey, human) muscles forming two discrete groups. In non-primates, muscles with a single endplate band, fascicles were always shorter than 35 mm, fixing the limit of fiber length served by one neuromuscular junction. Muscles with fascicles longer than this had multiple discrete bands of motor endplates crossing their width at regular intervals. An increase in muscle length across or within species corresponded to an equivalent, standard increase of 10-12 mm fascicle length per motor endplate band. All human and monkey leg muscles, with the exception of gracilis and sartorius, were singly innervated and all muscle fibers ran the full distance from tendon to tendon. Singly innervated primate muscle fibers were up to 140 mm long whereas the mean distance between endplate bands in the two multiply innervated muscles was also considerably greater than in non-primates. These data indicate that allometric effects of increasing fascicle length, are distinct in common laboratory animals and two primates, when architecture and pattern of innervation are compared.

abstract = {Postural control may be an ideal physiological motor task for elucidating general questions about the organization, diversity, flexibility, and variability of biological motor behaviors using nonlinear dynamical analysis techniques. Rather than presenting "problems" to the nervous system, the redundancy of biological systems and variability in their behaviors may actually be exploited to allow for the flexible achievement of multiple and concurrent task-level goals associated with movement. Such variability may reflect the constant "tuning" of neuromechanical elements and their interactions for movement control. The problem faced by researchers is that there is no one-to-one mapping between the task goal and the coordination of the underlying elements. We review recent and ongoing research in postural control with the goal of identifying common mechanisms underlying variability in postural control, coordination of multiple postural strategies, and transitions between them. We present a delayed-feedback model used to characterize the variability observed in muscle coordination patterns during postural responses to perturbation. We emphasize the significance of delays in physiological postural systems, requiring the modulation and coordination of both the instantaneous, "passive" response to perturbations as well as the delayed, "active" responses to perturbations. The challenge for future research lies in understanding the mechanisms and principles underlying neuromechanical tuning of and transitions between the diversity of postural behaviors. Here we describe some of our recent and ongoing studies aimed at understanding variability in postural control using physical robotic systems, human experiments, dimensional analysis, and computational models that could be enhanced from a nonlinear dynamics approach.

abstract = {The nervous systems of animals evolved to exert dynamic control of behavior in response to the needs of the animal and changing signals from the environment. To understand the mechanisms of dynamic control requires a means of predicting how individual neural and body elements will interact to produce the performance of the entire system. AnimatLab is a software tool that provides an approach to this problem through computer simulation. AnimatLab enables a computational model of an animal's body to be constructed from simple building blocks, situated in a virtual 3D world subject to the laws of physics, and controlled by the activity of a multicellular, multicompartment neural circuit. Sensor receptors on the body surface and inside the body respond to external and internal signals and then excite central neurons, while motor neurons activate Hill muscle models that span the joints and generate movement. AnimatLab provides a common neuromechanical simulation environment in which to construct and test models of any skeletal animal, vertebrate or invertebrate. The use of AnimatLab is demonstrated in a neuromechanical simulation of human arm flexion and the myotactic and contact-withdrawal reflexes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. The latency between the appearance of a popout search display and the eye movement to the oddball target of the display varies from trial to trial in both humans and monkeys. The source of the delay and variability of reaction time is unknown but has been attributed to as yet poorly defined decision processes. 2. We recorded neural activity in the frontal eye field (FEF), an area regarded as playing a central role in producing purposeful eye movements, of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performing a popout visual search task. Eighty-four neurons with visually evoked activity were analyzed. Twelve of these neurons had a phasic response associated with the presentation of the visual stimulus. The remaining neurons had more tonic responses that persisted through the saccade. Many of the neurons with more tonic responses resembled visuomovement cells in that they had activity that increased before a saccade into their response field. 3. The visual response latencies of FEF neurons were determined with the use of a Poisson spike train analysis. The mean visual latency was 67 ms (minimum = 35 ms, maximum = 138 ms). The visual response latencies to the target presented alone, to the target presented with distractors, or to the distractors did not differ significantly. 4. The initial visual activation of FEF neurons does not discriminate the target from the distractors of a popout visual search stimulus array, but the activity evolves to a state that discriminates whether the target of the search display is within the receptive field. We tested the hypothesis that the source of variability of saccade latency is the time taken by neurons involved in saccade programming to select the target for the gaze shift. 5. With the use of an analysis adapted from signal detection theory, we determined when the activity of single FEF neurons can reliably indicate whether the target or distractors are present within their response fields. The time of target discrimination partitions the reaction time into a perceptual stage in which target discrimination takes place, and a motor stage in which saccade programming and generation take place. The time of target discrimination occurred most often between 120 and 150 ms after stimulus presentation. 6. We analyzed the time course of target discrimination in the activity of single cells after separating trials into short, medium, and long saccade latency groups. Saccade latency was not correlated with the duration of the perceptual stage but was correlated with the duration of the motor stage. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the time taken for target discrimination, as indexed by FEF neurons, accounts for the wide variability in the time of movement initiation. 7. We conclude that the variability observed in saccade latencies during a simple visual search task is largely due to postperceptual motor processing following target discrimination. Signatures of both perceptual and postperceptual processing are evident in FEF. Procrastination in the output stage may prevent stereotypical behavior that would be maladaptive in a changing environment.},

abstract = {Vestibular signals are strongly integrated with information from several other sensory modalities. For example, vestibular stimulation was reported to improve tactile detection. However, this improvement could reflect either a multimodal interaction or an indirect interaction driven by vestibular effects on spatial attention and orienting. Here we investigate whether natural vestibular activation induced by passive whole-body rotation influences tactile detection. In particular, we assessed the ability to detect faint tactile stimuli to the fingertips of the left and right hand during spatially congruent or incongruent rotations. We found that passive whole-body rotations significantly enhanced sensitivity to faint shocks, without affecting response bias. Critically, this enhancement of somatosensory sensitivity did not depend on the spatial congruency between the direction of rotation and the hand stimulated. Thus, our results support a multimodal interaction, likely in brain areas receiving both vestibular and somatosensory signals.},

abstract = {The motor unit twitch torque is modified by sustained contraction, but the association to changes in muscle fiber electrophysiological properties is not fully known. Thus twitch torque, muscle fiber conduction velocity, and action potential properties of single motor units were assessed in 11 subjects following an isometric submaximal contraction of the tibialis anterior muscle until endurance. The volunteers activated a target motor unit at the minimum discharge rate in eight 3-min-long contractions, three before and five after an isometric contraction at 40{\%} of the maximal torque, sustained until endurance. Multichannel surface electromyogram signals and joint torque were averaged with the target motor unit potential as trigger. Discharge rate (mean +/- SE, 6.6 +/- 0.2 pulses/s) and interpulse interval variability (33.3 +/- 7.0{\%}) were not different in the eight contractions. Peak twitch torque and recruitment threshold increased significantly (93 +/- 29 and 12 +/- 5{\%}, P <0.05) in the contraction immediately after the endurance task with respect to the preendurance values (0.94 +/- 0.26 mN.m and 3.7 +/- 0.5{\%} of the maximal torque), whereas time to peak of the twitch torque did not change (74.4 +/- 10.1 ms). Muscle fiber conduction velocity decreased and action potential duration increased in the contraction after the endurance (6.3 +/- 1.8 and 9.8 +/- 1.8{\%}, respectively, P <0.05; preendurance values, 3.9 +/- 0.2 m/s and 11.1 +/- 0.8 ms), whereas the surface potential peak-to-peak amplitude did not change (27.1 +/- 3.1 microV). There was no significant correlation between the relative changes in muscle fiber conduction velocity or surface potential duration and in peak twitch torque (R2= 0.04 and 0.10, respectively). In conclusion, modifications in peak twitch torque of low-threshold motor units with sustained contraction are mainly determined by mechanisms not related to changes in action potential shape and in its propagation velocity.},

abstract = {The Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) test has been extensively used to investigate the responsiveness of Ia afferent spinal loop in animal and human studies. The H-reflex response is influenced by multiple neural pathways and the assessment of H-reflex variation is a useful tool in understanding the neural mechanisms in control of movement. Recently, several studies have examined the relationship between the H-reflex modulation and postural stability. For example, it has been reported that the amplitude of soleus (SOL) H-reflex is depressed in relation to increased body sway during upright standing on a soft surface compared to that on a solid surface. It has been suggested that the SOL H-reflex modulation under such condition is predominately affected by the presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms for avoiding oversaturation of the spinal motoneurons. It has also been reported that after balance training, the SOL H-reflex amplitude is down-modulated in parallel with improvement in balance control, suggesting a functional adaptation at the supraspinal levels. The aim of this review is to examine the current literature on the relationship between H-reflex modulation and postural control for a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in control of posture in humans.},

abstract = {We used galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to identify human balance reflexes of the semicircular canals and otolith organs. The experiment used a model of vestibular signals arising from GVS modulation of the net signal from vestibular afferents. With the head upright, the model predicts that the GVS-evoked canal signal indicates lateral head rotation while the otolith signal indicates lateral tilt or acceleration. Both signify body sway transverse to the head. With the head bent forward, the model predicts that the canal signal indicates body spin about a vertical axis but the otolith signal still signifies lateral body motion. Thus, we compared electromyograms (EMG) in the leg muscles and body sway evoked by GVS when subjects stood with the head upright or bent forward. With the head upright, GVS evoked a large sway in the direction of the anodal electrode. This response was abolished with the head bent forward leaving only small, oppositely directed, transient responses at the start and end of the stimulus. With the head upright, GVS evoked short-latency (60-70 ms), followed by medium-latency (120 ms) EMG responses, of opposite polarity. Bending the head forward abolished the medium-latency but preserved the short-latency response. This is compatible with GVS evoking separate otolithic and canal reflexes, indicating that balance is controlled by independent canal and otolith reflexes, probably through different pathways. We propose that the short-latency reflex and small transient sway are driven by the otolith organs and the medium-latency response and the large sway are driven by the semicircular canals.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to highlight the motor mechanisms involved in balance as the human, as a biped, continuously defends against gravitational and internal forces to maintain a safe posture. The search for these mechanisms needs precise and valid 3D measurements including both limbs plus valid biomechanical models. The literature shows the need for two force platforms to separate the mechanisms at the ankle and hip (load/unload mechanism). Also, precise measures (approximate to0.03 mm) of markers on a multi-segment 3D bilateral model are required to record the minute trajectories of all segments and joints. The controlled variable, center-of-mass, is seen to be virtually in phase with the controlling variable, the center-of-pressure, which suggests a 0th order system where a simple series elastic spring could maintain balance. The first model involves a mass/spring/damper of medial/lateral balance: the stiffness was varied with stance width and the predicted sway from a spring controlled inverted pendulum closely matched the experimentally measured stiffness and sway. The second was a non-linear model of the plantarflexor series elastic elements which resulted in three closely validated predictions of anterior/posterior balance: the locus of the gravitational load line, the predicted ankle moment and the ankle stiffness at the operating point.

abstract = {There is considerable evidence that lower-limb somatosensation contributes to the control of upright balance. In this study, we investigated the specific role of foot sole cutaneous afferents in the generation of balance corrections following lateral accelerations of the support surface. Participants were subjected to balance perturbations before and after targeted anesthesia of the cutaneous soles induced by intradermal injections of local anesthetic. Subject responses were quantified in terms of net joint torques at the ankles, hips and trunk. Contrary to the conclusions drawn in earlier studies, response torque impulses at the ankles and hips were clearly scaled with the perturbation impulse under both control and anesthetized conditions. Reduced plantar sensitivity produced a relative shift in compensatory torque production from the ankles and trunk to the hips. These findings demonstrate that plantar cutaneous afferents play an important role in the shaping of dynamic postural responses. Furthermore, the results suggest that loss of plantar sensation may be an important contributor to the dynamic balance deficits and increased risk of falls associated with peripheral neuropathies.},

abstract = {Dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are uniquely sensitive to degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its models. Although a variety of molecular characteristics have been proposed to underlie this sensitivity, one possible contributory factor is their massive, unmyelinated axonal arbor that is orders of magnitude larger than other neuronal types. We suggest that this puts them under such a high energy demand that any stressor that perturbs energy production leads to energy demand exceeding supply and subsequent cell death. One prediction of this hypothesis is that those dopamine neurons that are selectively vulnerable in PD will have a higher energy cost than those that are less vulnerable. We show here, through the use of a biology-based computational model of the axons of individual dopamine neurons, that the energy cost of axon potential propagation and recovery of the membrane potential increases with the size and complexity of the axonal arbor according to a power law. Thus SNc dopamine neurons, particularly in humans, whose axons we estimate to give rise to more than 1 million synapses and have a total length exceeding 4 m, are at a distinct disadvantage with respect to energy balance which may be a factor in their selective vulnerability in PD.},

abstract = {Suppose that the variability in our movements is caused not by noise in the motor system itself, nor by fluctuations in our intentions or plans, but rather by errors in our sensory estimates of the external parameters that define the appropriate action. For tasks in which precision is at a premium, performance would be optimal if no noise were added in movement planning and execution: motor output would be as accurate as possible given the quality of sensory inputs. Here we use visually guided smooth-pursuit eye movements in primates as a testing ground for this notion of optimality. In response to repeated presentations of identical target motions, nearly 92{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variance in eye trajectory can be accounted for as a consequence of errors in sensory estimates of the speed, direction and timing of target motion, plus a small background noise that is observed both during eye movements and during fixations. The magnitudes of the inferred sensory errors agree with the observed thresholds for sensory discrimination by perceptual systems, suggesting that the very different neural processes of perception and action are limited by the same sources of noise.},

abstract = {A dynamical model of the neuro-musculo-skeletal mechanics of a cat hindlimb has been developed to investigate the feedback regulation of standing posture under small perturbations. The model is a three-joint limb, moving only in the sagittal plane, driven by 10 musculotendon actuators, each having response dynamics dependent on activation kinetics and muscle kinematics. Under small perturbations, the nonlinear postural regulation mechanism is approximately linear. Sensors exist which could provide state feedback. Thus, the linear quadratic regulator is proposed as a model for the structure of the feedback controller for regulation, of small perturbations. System states are chosen to correspond to the known outputs of physiological sensors: muscle forces (sensed by tendon organs), a combination of muscle lengths and velocities (sensed by spindle organs), joint angles and velocities (sensed by joint receptors), and motoneuron activities (sensed by Renshaw cells). Thus, the feedback gain matrices computed can be related to the spinal neural circuits. Several proposals for control strategy have been tested under this formulation. It is shown that a strategy of regulating all the states leads to controllers that best mimic the externally measured behavior of real cats.},

The maps were assembled from histological cross sections stained for acetylcholinesterase activity. Within MGL, the motor endplates formed three columns along its longitudinal axis. Within MGM, the motor endplates were arranged in a leaf-like body that shifted obliquely from proximal to distal. As inferred from the proximo-distal distribution of the cross-sectional projection area, the majority of the motor endplates were concentrated in the middle of MGL and in the distal third of MGM. Regions of maximal motor endplate concentration are considered most suitable for injections of neuroactive substances, such as neuronal tracers. The assembled maps of the gastrocnemius muscles can be used as guides for such injections within the motor endplate zones.},

abstract = {Although the movement of the leg during swing phase is often compared to the unforced motion of a compound pendulum, the muscles of the leg are active during swing and presumably influence its motion. To examine the roles of muscles in determining swing phase knee flexion, we developed a muscle-actuated forward-dynamic simulation of the swing phase of normal gait. Joint angles and angular velocities at toe-off were derived from experimental measurements, as were pelvis motions and muscle excitations. Joint angles and joint moments resulting from the simulation corresponded to experimental measurements made during normal gait. Muscular joint moments and initial joint angular velocities were altered to determine the effects of each upon peak knee flexion in swing phase. As expected, the simulation demonstrated that either increasing knee extension moment or decreasing toe-off knee flexion velocity decreased peak knee flexion. Decreasing hip flexion moment or increasing toe-off hip flexion velocity also caused substantial decreases in peak knee flexion. The rectus femoris muscle played an important role in regulating knee flexion; removal of the rectus femoris actuator from the model resulted in hyperflexion of the knee, whereas an increase in the excitation input to the rectus femoris actuator reduced knee flexion. These findings confirm that reduced knee flexion during the swing phase (stiff-knee gait) may be caused by overactivity of the rectus femoris. The simulations also suggest that weakened hip flexors and stance phase factors that determine the angular velocities of the knee and hip at toe-off may be responsible for decreased knee flexion during swing phase.

Despite the widespread application of the technique, it has not been fully established how the characteristics of the observed coherence are related to the properties of the shared motoneuron inputs. In addition, the exact relationship between coherence and traditional measures of motor unit synchronization remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of shared motoneuron inputs on coherence between motor unit discharge patterns using computer simulations. Although less sensitive to motor unit firing rates than traditional synchronization-based indices, coherence tended to decrease with increasing frequency of the common input and to increase slightly when the common input frequency was close to the motor unit firing rates. In addition, coherence tended to be highest between motor units with similar firing rates. A linear association was observed between synchronization and coherence in the 15-30 Hz range and between 'common drive' and coherence in the 0-5 Hz range. The results suggest that caution should be taken when interpreting differences in coherence observed between motor units with significantly different firing properties or when comparing data with coherence in different frequency ranges. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We next review the precision of those simulation strategies, in particular in cases where plasticity depends on the exact timing of the spikes. We overview different simulators and simulation environments presently available (restricted to those freely available, open source and documented). For each simulation tool, its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow the reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models are implemented on the different simulators, and the codes are made available. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide a resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate integration strategy and simulation tool to use for a given modeling problem related to spiking neural networks.},

abstract = {Oscillations in the primary motor cortex are transmitted through the corticospinal tract to the motoneuron pool. This pathway is believed to produce an effective and direct command from the motor cortex to the spinal motoneurons for the modulation of the force output. In this study, we used a computational model of a population of motoneurons to investigate the factors that can influence the transmission of the cortical input to the output of motoneurons, since it can be quantified by coherence analysis. The simulations demonstrated that, despite the nonlinearity of the motoneurons, oscillations present in the cortical input are transmitted to the output of the motoneuron pool at the same frequency. However, the interference introduced by the nonlinearity of the system increases the variability of the oscillations in output, introducing spectral lines whose frequency depends on the input frequencies and the motoneuron discharge rates. Moreover, an additional source of synaptic input common to all motoneurons but independent from the corticospinal component decorrelates the cortical input and motoneuron output and, thus, decreases the magnitude of the estimated coherence, even if the effective cortical drive does not change. These results indicate that the corticospinal input can effectively be sampled by a small population of motoneurons. However, the transmission of a corticospinal drive to the motoneuron pool is influenced by the nonlinearity of the spiking processes of the active motoneurons and by synaptic inputs common to the motoneuron population but independent from the cortical input.},

A further objective was to verify the use of the available literature data to assess the contribution of each muscle of the group to the entire TS volume or physiological cross-sectional-area (PCSA). Therefore, magnetic resonance images of the right call of 13 male subjects were acquired and each muscle of the TS was reconstructed. Muscle length (l(m)) the maximum anatomical cross-sectional-area (ACSA(max)) and muscle volume were obtained from the 3D models. To assess the PCSA, fascicle length was determined by ultrasonography. In general, muscle volume can be expressed as a fraction of the product of ACSA(max) and l(m). The size of the fraction depends on muscle shape and its coefficient of variance among the examined population was considerable low (soleus 6{\%}, gastrocnemius 4{\%} and gastrocnemius lateralis 7{\%}) in the present study. The product of ACSA(max) and l(m) was, therefore, suitable to assess muscle volume (root mean squares, RMS 4-7{\%}). Further, the soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis accounted on average for about 52 +/- 3{\%}, 32 +/- 2{\%}, and 16 +/- 2{\%} of the total TS volume and 62 +/- 50{\%}, 26 +/- 3{\%} and 12 +/- 2{\%} or the entire TS PCSA, respectively. The coefficient of variance of the relative portions were 5-10{\%} for muscle volume and 8-17{\%} for the PCSA. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. This study investigated the reflex control of postural sway during human bipedal stance. The experiments were designed to: (i) find evidence for the operation of 'stretch reflex' pathways during quiet stance, (ii) determine the bandwidth of the reflex response, (iii) describe the reflex transmission characteristics in standing subjects, and (iv) assess the ability of subjects to make a task-dependent change in the reflex. 2. A continuous random perturbation that did not threaten stability was applied at waist level to nine standing subjects. The effects of the perturbation on ankle torque, ankle movement and soleus electromyographic activity (EMG) were identified by cross-correlation. The bandwidth of the reflex response and the transmission characteristics of reflexes that respond to ankle movement were identified by spectral analysis. Changes in these reflex responses were investigated when subjects attempted to stand as still as possible, had their eyes closed, or balanced a load equivalent to their own body in a situation in which neither visual nor vestibular reflexes would be activated. 3. When standing, a reflex response coherent with the perturbation was seen in soleus EMG at frequencies up to 5 Hz, with maximal coherence at 1.0-2.0 Hz. Reflex gain increased with frequency, and there was a frequency-dependent phase advance of soleus EMG on ankle movement reaching 135 deg at 3 Hz. When attempting to minimize sway, subjects produced a more coherent reflex response and significantly increased reflex gain. 4. The response and transmission characteristics of the lower limb proprioceptive reflex in freely standing subjects were similar to those in subjects balancing a load at the ankle, a situation in which vestibular and visual inputs could not contribute. 5. It is concluded that reflex feedback related to ankle movement contributes significantly to maintaining stance, and that much of the reflex response originates from lower limb mechanoreceptors stimulated by ankle rotation. Although reflex gain may be relatively low during quiet stance it can be increased when necessary to maintain stability.},

abstract = {After chronic spinal injury, motoneurons spontaneously develop two persistent inward currents (PICs): a TTX-sensitive persistent sodium current (sodium PIC) and a nimodipine-sensitive persistent calcium current (calcium PIC). In the present paper, we examined how these PICs contributed to motoneuron firing. Adult rats were spinalized at the S 2 sacral level, and after 2 months intracellular recordings were made from sacrocaudal motoneurons in vitro. The PICs and repetitive firing were measured with slow triangular voltage and current ramps, respectively. The sodium PIC was examined after blocking the calcium PIC with nimodipine (20 muM; n=12). It was always activated subthreshold, and during current ramps in nimodipine, it produced a sodium plateau that assisted in initiating and maintaining firing (self-sustained firing). The sodium PIC oscillated off and on during firing and helped initiate each spike, and near threshold this caused abnormally slow firing (2.82+/-1.21 Hz). A low dose of TTX (0.5 muM) blocked the sodium PIC, sodium plateau, and very slow firing prior to affecting the spike itself. The calcium PIC was estimated as the current blocked by nimodipine or current remaining in TTX (2 muM; n=13). In 59{\%} of motoneurons, the calcium PIC was activated subthreshold to firing and produced a plateau that assisted in initiating and sustaining firing because nimodipine significantly increased the firing threshold current and decreased the self-sustained firing. In the remaining motoneurons (41{\%}), the calcium PIC was activated suprathreshold to firing and during current ramps did not initially affect firing but eventually was activated and caused an acceleration in firing followed by self-sustained firing, which were blocked by nimodipine. The frequency-current (F-I) slope was 3.0+/-1.0 Hz/nA before the calcium PIC activation (primary range), 6.3+/-3.6 Hz/nA during the calcium PIC onset (secondary range; acceleration), and 2.1+/-1.3 Hz/nA with the calcium PIC steadily activated (tertiary range). Nimodipine eliminated the secondary and tertiary ranges, leaving a linear F-I slope of 3.7+/-1.0 Hz/nA. A single low-threshold shock to the dorsal root evoked a many-second-long discharge, the counterpart of a muscle spasm in the awake chronic spinal rat. This long-lasting reflex was caused by the motoneuron PICs because when the activation of the voltage-dependent PICs was prevented by hyperpolarization, the same dorsal root stimulation only produced a brief excitatory postsynaptic potential (<1 s). Both the calcium and sodium PIC were involved because nimodipine only partly reduced the reflex and there remained very slow firing mediated by the sodium PIC.},

abstract = {Our objective was to investigate how cooling of the arm and vision influence pointing movements in healthy subjects and patients with cerebellar limb ataxia due to clinically proven multiple sclerosis. An infrared video motion analysis system was used to record the unrestricted, horizontal pointing movements toward a target under three different conditions involving a moving, stationary, or imaginary target; a visual, or acoustic trigger; and vision or memory guidance. All three tasks were performed before and after cooling the arm in ice water. Patients had more hypermetric and slower pointing movements than controls under all tested conditions. Patients also had significantly larger three-dimensional finger sway paths during the postural phase and larger movement angles of the wrist joint. Memory-guided movements were the most hypermetric recorded in both groups. Cooling of the limb had no effect on amplitude or peak velocity of the pointing movement in either group under all tested conditions, but significantly reduced the three-dimensional finger sway path during the postural phase in patients with limb ataxia. Cooling-induced reduction of the finger sway was largest in those patients with the largest finger sway before cooling. In conclusion, the cooling-induced reduction of the proprioceptive afferent inflow, most probably of group I spindle afferents, reduces postural tremor of patients with cerebellar dysfunction.},

abstract = {For a model cortical neuron with three active conductances, we studied the dependence of the firing rate on the degree of synchrony in its synaptic inputs. The effect of synchrony was determined as a function of three parameters: number of inputs, average input frequency, and the synaptic strength (maximal unitary conductance change). Synchrony alone could increase the cell's firing rate when the product of these three parameters was below a critical value. But for higher values of the three parameters, synchrony could reduce firing rate. Instantaneous responses to time-varying input firing rates were close to predictions from steady-state responses when input synchrony was high, but fell below steady-state responses when input synchrony was low. Effectiveness of synaptic transmission, measured by the peak area of cross-correlations between input and output spikes, increased with increasing synchrony.},

abstract = {Biological systems are notoriously noisy. Noise, therefore, also plays an important role in many models of neural impulse generation. Noise is not only introduced for more realistic simulations but also to account for cooperative effects between noisy and nonlinear dynamics. Often, this is achieved by a simple noise term in the membrane equation (current noise). However, there are ongoing discussions whether such current noise is justified or whether rather conductance noise should be introduced because it is closer to the natural origin of noise. Therefore, we have compared the effects of current and conductance noise in a neuronal model for subthreshold oscillations and action potential generation. We did not see any significant differences in the model behavior with respect to voltage traces, tuning curves of interspike intervals, interval distributions or frequency responses when the noise strength is adjusted. These findings indicate that simple current noise can give reasonable results in neuronal simulations with regard to physiological relevant noise effects. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The exact mechanical function of synergist muscles within a human limb in vivo is not well described. Recent studies indicate the existence of a mechanical interaction between muscle actuators that may have functional significance and further play a role for injury mechanisms. The purpose of the present study was to investigate if intermuscular force transmission occurs within and between human plantarflexor muscles in vivo. Seven subjects performed four types of either active contractile tasks or passive joint manipulations: passive knee extension, voluntary isometric plantarflexion, voluntary isometric hallux flexion, passive hallux extension, and selective percutaneous stimulation of the gastrocnemius medialis (MG). In each experiment plantar-and hallux flexion force and corresponding EMG activity were sampled. During all tasks ultrasonography was applied at proximal and distal sites to assess task-induced tissue displacement (which is assumed to represent loading) for the plantarflexor muscles [MG, soleus (SOL), and flexor hallucis longus (FHL)]. Selective MG stimulation and passive knee extension resulted in displacement of both the MG and SOL muscles. Minimal displacement of the triceps surae muscles was seen during passive hallux extension. Large interindividual differences with respect to deep plantarflexor activation during voluntary contractions were observed. The present results suggest that force may be transmitted between the triceps surae muscles in vivo, while only limited evidence was provided for the occurrence of force transfer between the triceps surae and the deeper-lying FHL.},

abstract = {Rectification of surface EMG before spectral analysis is a well-established preprocessing method used in the detection of motor unit firing patterns. A number of recent studies have called into question the need for rectification before spectral analysis, pointing out that there is no supporting experimental evidence to justify rectification. We present an analysis of 190 records from 13 subjects consisting of simultaneous recordings of paired single motor units and surface EMG from the extensor digitorum longus muscle during middle finger extension against gravity (unloaded condition) and against gravity plus inertial loading (loaded condition). We directly examine the hypothesis that rectified surface EMG is a better predictor of the frequency components of motor unit synchronization than the unrectified (or raw) EMG in the beta-frequency band (15-32 Hz). We use multivariate analysis and estimate the partial coherence between the paired single units using both rectified and unrectified surface EMG as a predictor. We use a residual partial correlation measure to quantify the difference between raw and rectified EMG as predictor and analyze unloaded and loaded conditions separately. The residual correlation for the unloaded condition is 22{\{}{\%}{\}} with raw EMG and 3.5{\{}{\%}{\}} with rectified EMG and for the loaded condition it is 5.2{\{}{\%}{\}} with raw EMG and 1.4{\{}{\%}{\}} with rectified EMG. We interpret these results as strong supporting experimental evidence in favor of using the preprocessing step of surface EMG rectification before spectral analysis.},

abstract = {We propose a model for human postural balance, combining state feedback control with optimal state estimation. State estimation uses an internal model of body and sensor dynamics to process sensor information and determine body orientation. Three sensory modalities are modeled: joint proprioception, vestibular organs in the inner ear, and vision. These are mated with a two degree-of-freedom model of body dynamics in the sagittal plane. Linear quadratic optimal control is used to design state feedback and estimation gains. Nine free parameters define the control objective and the signal-to-noise ratios of the sensors. The model predicts statistical properties of human sway in terms of covariance of ankle and hip motion. These predictions are compared with normal human responses to alterations in sensory conditions. With a single parameter set, the model successfully reproduces the general nature of postural motion as a function of sensory environment. Parameter variations reveal that the model is highly robust under normal sensory conditions, but not when two or more sensors are inaccurate. This behavior is similar to that of normal human subjects. We propose that age-related sensory changes may be modeled with decreased signal-to-noise ratios, and compare the model's behavior with degraded sensors against experimental measurements from older adults. We also examine removal of the model's vestibular sense, which leads to instability similar to that observed in bilateral vestibular loss subjects. The model may be useful for predicting which sensors are most critical for balance, and how much they can deteriorate before posture becomes unstable.},

abstract = {During quiet standing the human 'inverted pendulum' sways irregularly. In previous work where subjects balanced a real inverted pendulum, we investigated what contribution the intrinsic mechanical ankle stiffness makes to achieve stability. Using the results of a plausible model, we suggested that intrinsic ankle stiffness is inadequate for providing stability. Here, using a piezoelectric translator we applied small, unobtrusive mechanical perturbations to the foot while the subject was standing freely. These short duration perturbations had a similar size and velocity to movements which occur naturally during quiet standing, and they produced no evidence of any stretch reflex response in soleus, or gastrocnemius. Direct measurement confirms our earlier conclusion; intrinsic ankle stiffness is not quite sufficient to stabilise the body or pendulum. On laverage the directly determined intrinsic stiffness is 91 +/- 23{\%} (mean +/- S.D.) of that necessary to provide minimal stabilisation. The stiffness was substantially constant, increasing only slightly with ankle torque. This stiffness cannot be neurally regulated in quiet standing. Thus we attribute this stiffness to the foot, Achilles' tendon and aponeurosis rather than the activated calf muscle fibres. Our measurements suggest that the triceps surae muscles maintain balance via a spring-like element which is itself too compliant to guarantee stability. The implication is that the brain cannot set ankle stiffness and then ignore the control task because additional modulation of torque is required to maintain balance. We suggest that the triceps surae muscles maintain balance by predictively controlling the proximal offset of the spring-like element in a ballistic-like manner.},

abstract = {Eight functionally identified group Ia muscle afferents from triceps surae or plantaris muscles were labeled intraaxonally with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in seven adult cats. Subsequently, HRP was injected into two to six homonymous or heteronymous alpha-motoneurons per animal (total = 22), each identified by motor unit type and located near the site of afferent injection. The complete trajectories of labeled afferents were reconstructed, and putative synaptic contacts on HRP-labeled motoneurons were identified at high magnification. Dendritic paths from each contact were also mapped and measured. A total of 24 contact systems (the combination of a group Ia afferent and a postsynaptic motoneuron) were reconstructed, of which 17 were homonymous, and seven were heteronymous. Overall, homonymous contact systems had an average of 9.6 boutons, whereas heteronymous contact systems had an average of 5.9 boutons. The average number of boutons found on type S motoneurons in homonymous contact systems was smaller (6.4, range 3-17) than in systems involving types FF or FR motoneurons (FF: 10.4, range 4-18; FR: 11.3, range 4-32). Neither of these differences were statistically significant. In contrast to earlier reports, a majority (15/24) of contact systems included more than one collateral from the same Ia afferent. The complexity (number of branch points) in the arborization pathway leading to each contact (overall mean 8.4 +/- 3.3) was virtually identical in all contact systems, irrespective of the type of the postsynaptic motoneuron. The three-dimensional distribution of group Ia contacts was not coextensive with the radially organized dendrites of motoneurons: Dendrites oriented in the ventromedial to dorsolateral axis had the fewest (8{\%}) contacts, whereas rostrocaudal dendrites had the most (63{\%}) contacts. Nevertheless, contacts were widely distributed on the motoneuron surface, with few on and near the soma (less than or equal to 200 mu m radial distance from the soma) or on the most distal parts of the tree (greater than or equal to 1,000 mu m) The boutons in individual contact systems also showed wide spatial and estimated electrotonic distributions; only 3/24 systems had all contact located within a restricted spatial/electrotonic region. The relations between these anatomical results and existing electrophysiological data on group Ia synaptic potentials are discussed. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Heckman2009a,
abstract = {The excitability of spinal motoneurons is both fundamental for motor behavior and essential in diagnosis of neural disorders. There are two mechanisms for altering this excitability. The classic mechanism is mediated by synaptic inputs that depolarize or hyperpolarize motoneurons by generating postsynaptic potentials. This "ionotropic" mechanism works via neurotransmitters that open ion channels in the cell membrane. In the second mechanism, neurotransmitters bind to receptors that activate intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways modulate the properties of the voltage-sensitive channels that determine the intrinsic input-output properties of motoneurons. This "neuromodulatory" mechanism usually does not directly activate motoneurons but instead dramatically alters the neuron's response to ionotropic inputs. We present extensive evidence that neuromodulatory inputs exert a much more powerful effect on motoneuron excitability than ionotropic inputs. The most potent neuromodulators are probably serotonin and norepinephrine, which are released by axons originating in the brainstem and can increase motoneuron excitability fivefold or more. Thus, the standard tests of motoneuron excitability (H-reflexes, tendon taps, tendon vibration and stretch reflexes) are strongly influenced by the level of neuromodulatory input to motoneurons. This insight is likely to be profoundly important for clinical diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract = {This study of cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle and motor unit (MU) properties tests the hypothesis that the normal ranges of MU contractile force, endurance, and speed are directly associated with the amount of neuromuscular activity normally experienced by each MU. We synchronously activated all MUs in the MG muscle with the same activity (20 Hz in a 50{\%} duty cycle) and asked whether conversion of whole muscle contractile properties is associated with loss of the normal heterogeneity in MU properties. Chronically implanted cuff electrodes on the nerve to MG muscle were used for 24-h/day stimulation and for monitoring progressive changes in contractile force, endurance, and speed by periodic recording of maximal isometric twitch and tetanic contractions under halothane anesthesia. Chronic low-frequency stimulation slowed muscle contractions and made them weaker, and increased muscle endurance. The most rapid and least variable response to stimulation was a decline in force output of the muscle and constituent MUs. Fatigue resistance increased more slowly, whereas the increase in time to peak force varied most widely between animals and occurred with a longer time course than either force or endurance. Changes in contractile force, endurance, and speed of the whole MG muscle accurately reflected changes in the properties of the constituent MUs both in extent and time course. Normally there is a 100-fold range in tetanic force and a 10-fold range in fatigue indexes and twitch time to peak force. After chronic stimulation, the range in these properties was significantly reduced and, even in MU samples from single animals, the range was shown to correspond with the slow (type S) MUs of the normal MG. In no case was the range reduced to less than the type S range. The same results were obtained when the same chronic stimulation pattern of 20 Hz/50{\%} duty cycle was imposed on paralyzed muscles after hemisection and unilateral deafferentation. The findings that the properties of MUs still varied within the normal range of type S MUs and were still heterogeneous despite a decline in the variance in any one property indicate that the neuromuscular activity can account only in part for the wide range of muscle properties. It is concluded that the normal range of properties within MU types reflects an intrinsic regulation of properties in the multinucleated muscle fibers.},

The 17,000 tactile units in this skin area of the human hand are of four different types: two fast adapting types, FA I and FA II (formerly RA and PC), and two slowly adapting types, SA I and SA II. The receptive field characteristics and the densities in the skin of the type I units (FA I and SA I) indicate that these account for the detailed spatial resolution that is of paramount importance for the motor skill and the explorative role of the hand. The relationship between the stimulus amplitude and perceived intensity during sustained skin indentations did not match the corresponding stimulus response functions of SA units suggesting non-linear transformations within the central nervous system. These transformations, in turn, appear to vary between subjects. A single impulse in a single FA I unit may be felt when originating from the most important tactile regions of the hand, indicating that the psychophysical detection may be set by the threshold of the sense organs. Moreover, no significant noise seems to be superimposed in the respective central sensory pathways.},

abstract = {This review considers whether the vestibular system includes separate populations of sensory axons innervating individual organs and giving rise to distinct central pathways. There is a variability in the discharge properties of afferents supplying each organ. Discharge regularity provides a marker for this diversity since fibers which differ in this way also differ in many other properties. Postspike recovery of excitability determines the discharge regularity of an afferent and its sensitivity to depolarizing inputs. Sensitivity is small in regularly discharging afferents and large in irregularly discharging afferents. The enhanced sensitivity of irregular fibers explains their larger responses to sensory inputs, to efferent activation, and to externally applied galvanic currents, but not their distinctive response dynamics. Morphophysiological studies show that regular and irregular afferents innervate overlapping regions of the vestibular nuclei. Intracellular recordings of EPSPs reveal that some secondary vestibular neurons receive a restricted input from regular or irregular afferents, but that most such neurons receive a mixed input from both kinds of afferents. Anodal currents delivered to the labyrinth can result in a selective and reversible silencing of irregular afferents. Such a functional ablation can provide estimates of the relative contributions of regular and irregular inputs to a central neuron's discharge. From such estimates it is concluded that secondary neurons need not resemble their afferent inputs in discharge regularity or response dynamics. Several suggestions are made as to the potentially distinctive contributions made by regular and irregular afferents: (1) Reflecting their response dynamics, regular and irregular afferents could compensate for differences in the dynamic loads of various reflexes or of individual reflexes in different parts of their frequency range; (2) The gating of irregular inputs to secondary VOR neurons could modify the operation of reflexes under varying behavioral circumstances; (3) Two-dimensional sensitivity can arise from the convergence onto secondary neurons of otolith inputs differing in their directional properties and response dynamics; (4) Calyx afferents have relatively low gains when compared with irregular dimorphic afferents. This could serve to expand the stimulus range over which the response of calyx afferents remains linear, while at the same time preserving the other features peculiar to irregular afferents. Among those features are phasic response dynamics and large responses to efferent activation; (5) Because of the convergence of several afferents onto each secondary neuron, information transmission to the latter depends on the gain of individual afferents, but not on their discharge regularity.},

The present work assessed aging-related changes in postural sway using fractal and complexity measures of the center of pressure (COP) dynamics with the hypothesis that complexity and fractality decreases in the older individuals. Older subjects (68 +/- 4 years) and young adult subjects (28 +/- 7 years) performed a quiet stance task (60 s) and a prolonged standing task (30 min) where subjects were allowed to move freely. Long-range correlations (fractality) of the data were estimated by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA); changes in entropy were estimated by the multi-scale entropy (MSE) measure. The DFA results showed that the fractal dimension was lower for the older subjects in comparison to the young adults but the fractal dimensions of both groups were not different from a 1/f noise, for time intervals between 10 and 600 s. The MSE analysis performed with the typically applied adjustment to the criterion distance showed a higher degree of complexity in the older subjects, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that complexity in the human physiological system decreases with aging. The same MSE analysis performed without adjustment showed no differences between the groups. Taken all results together, the decrease in total postural sway and long-range correlations in older individuals are signs of an adaptation process reflecting the diminishing ability to generate adequate responses on a longer time scale.},

One assumption of the method is that individual motor units, recruited by peripheral nerve stimulation just above threshold, give discrete observable increments to the surface EMG which are typical of motor units in the muscle. We have investigated this assumption in the thenar muscle. An EMG needle was inserted into the muscle and a series of individual motor units, activated voluntarily, was isolated. The discharge of these units was then used to trigger averaging of the concurrent surface EMG. Our results suggest that motor units activated by peripheral nerve stimulation close to threshold are not representative, in amplitude or timing, in their contribution to the surface EMG, of all motor units in the muscle.},

Fourteen 3D morphologically detailed somata and dendrites of cat spinal alpha motoneurons have been imported from an open-access web-based database of neuronal morphologies, NeuroMorpho.org, and instantiated in neurocomputational models. An axon hillock, an axonal initial segment and a myelinated axon are added to each model. By sweeping the diameter of the axonal initial segment (AIS) and the axon hillock, as well as the maximal conductances of sodium channels at the AIS and at the soma, the developed models are able to show the relationships between different geometric and electrophysiological configurations and the voltage attenuation of the antidromically traveling wave. In particular, a greater than usually admitted sodium conductance at AIS is necessary and sufficient to overcome the dramatic voltage attenuation occurring during antidromic spike propagation both at the myelinated axon-AIS and at the AIS-soma transitions.},

@article{Fitzpatrick1996,
abstract = {1. In this study we measured the loop gain of postural reflexes in standing human subjects. Reflex activity is conventionally described in terms of the muscle activation arising from a perturbation, but in this study the ability of the evoked muscle activity to correct the perturbation was also measured, and the behavior of the entire feedback loop is described. 2. A weak continuous random perturbation was applied at waist level to standing subjects. The effects of the perturbation on body sway and soleus electromyogram (EMG) were identified by cross-correlation, and spectral analysis was used to estimate the open-loop reflex transmission characteristics (i.e., sway to EMG). Under the same conditions, activity in the leg muscles was evoked by galvanic vestibular stimulation with the use of a continuous randomly varying current. The effects on soleus EMG and the subsequent body sway were identified by cross-correlation. This allowed calculation of the open-loop muscle and load behavior (i.e., EMG to sway). From these open-loop reflex and muscle and load transfer functions, the loop gain and phase were calculated. 3. In addition to the gain of the feedback loop, the study describes the transmission characteristics of reflex responses in the leg muscles associated with body sway and the effects of excluding visual and proprioceptive contributions to the response; the transfer function of human soleus with a stimulus that preserves the normal recruitment of motoneurons, including the effects of different load conditions on the muscle; and the transmission characteristics of vestibular pathways that evoke responses in the leg muscles during standing in situations that might modify the reflexes. 4. When standing, the loop gain of reflex feedback is approximately unity and is unchanged by eye closure and stability of support. Reflex transmission introduced a marked phase advance, and this served to offset most of the phase lag introduced by muscle and load. The residual phase lag could explain the frequency of tremor observed during standing (6-8 Hz). 5. The gain of the feedback loop (approximately 1) is higher than suggested by both previous estimates and theoretical considerations, but is still insufficient to explain the stability of normal human standing. This implies that, although sensory information is used to control posture, it does not do so exclusively through a negative feedback control process. The experimental findings are consistent with a reflex response based on a feed-forward process, and this would result in prediction of the response necessary to counteract a postural disturbance.},

abstract = {Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in multiple sclerosis but is poorly understood. We investigated 'physiological' fatigue in 21 patients with multiple sclerosis who complained of disabling fatigue by measuring the decline in strength during a 45 s maximal contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle. The results were compared with those from a control group of 19 healthy subjects. The strength of control subjects declined by approximately 20{\{}{\%}{\}} during the contraction; twitch interpolation showed central drive remained almost maximal throughout, and therefore that the fatigue was peripheral in origin. Patients had normal baseline strength, but developed greater fatigue (approximately 45{\{}{\%}{\}}), which was central in origin. In both cases, the decline in strength followed a roughly linear time course suggesting that the patients, like the normals, were trying to maintain a maximum voluntary effort. Evidence for frequency-dependent conduction block (FDCB) in the patients' central motor pathways was sought by measuring the EMG responses to single and paired transcranial magnetic stimuli. Fatigue had no effect on the latency or size of EMG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting that FDCB was unlikely to have occurred. This was supported by measurements of the maximum speed of voluntary muscle contraction; although the patients showed relatively slow speeds before exercise, the decline in speed after fatigue was no greater than in normal subjects. We conclude that excessive 'physiological' fatigue contributes to the symptom of fatigue in multiple sclerosis and is central in origin. However, since the degree of exercise-induced fatigue did not correlate with the baseline complaint of fatigue, other factors must also be operating to produce the full range of clinical symptoms. We found no conclusive evidence that central fatigue is related to increased dysfunction in the primary central motor pathways and no evidence that FDCB is the pathophysiological mechanism. We postulate that central fatigue in multiple sclerosis is due to impaired drive to the primary motor cortex and several lines of evidence strongly suggest that this is not due to a lack of motivation.},

abstract = {This study determined the amplitude of force fluctuations for the ankle dorsiflexor (DF) and plantarflexor (PF) muscles of young and elderly adults. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force and isometric DF and PF steadiness (2.5-80{\%} MVC) was assessed in 11 young (23+/-3 years, 5 women, 6 men) and 10 elderly (73+/-6 years, 5 women, 5 men) adults. The coefficient of variation (CV) and power spectrum of the force was measured from the steadiness trials. MVC force was lower for elderly adults for PF (38{\%} lower, P=0.002) but not DF (20{\%} lower, P=0.14). For PF, the CV of force was greater for elderly than young adults at 2.5{\%} (2.64 vs. 1.71{\%}) and 5{\%} MVC (1.78 vs. 1.24{\%}), similar at 10, 50, and 80{\%} MVC, and greater for young than elderly at the 30{\%} MVC target force. For DF, the CV of force was similar for young and elderly at all target forces (P>0.05). The CV of force was 49{\%} lower for the PF compared with DF muscles across all target forces (P<0.0001). This difference was significantly greater at the 2.5 (58{\%}), 5 (58{\%}), and 10{\%} MVC (44{\%}) target forces compared with higher target forces. The power spectra of the force fluctuations for both muscles were consistently dominated by frequencies below 2 Hz. For elderly adults, the neuromuscular factors that underlie both muscle strength and force fluctuations during low-force contractions are impaired in the ankle plantarflexors but not the dorsiflexors.},

abstract = {Interactions between physiological stimulus frequencies, fascicle lengths and velocities were analyzed in feline caudofemoralis (CF), a hindlimb skeletal muscle composed exclusively of fast-twitch fibers. Split ventral roots were stimulated asynchronously to produce smooth contractions at sub-tetanic stimulus frequencies. As described previously, the peak of the sub-tetanic force-length relationship was found to shift to longer lengths with decreases in stimulus frequency, indicating a length dependence for activation that is independent of filament overlap. The sub-tetanic force-velocity (FV) relationship was affected strongly both by stimulus frequency and by length; decreases in either decreased the slope of the FV relationship around isometric. The shapes of the force transients following stretch or shortening revealed that these effects were not due to a change in the instantaneous FV relationship; the relative shape of the force transients following stretch or shortening was independent of stimulus frequency and hardly affected by length. The effects of stimulus frequency and length on the sub-tetanic FV relationship instead appear to be caused by a time delay in the length-dependent changes of activation. In contrast to feline soleus muscle, which is composed exclusively of slow-twitch fibers, CF did not yield at sub-tetanic stimulus frequencies for the range of stretch velocities tested (up to 2 L-0/s). The data presented here were used to build a model of muscle that accounted well for all of the effects described. We extended our model to account for slow-twitch muscle by comparing our fast-twitch model with previously published data and then changing the necessary parameters to fit the data. Our slow-twitch model accounts well for all previous findings including that of yielding.},

abstract = {This report describes an early version of a technique for decomposing surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals into the constituent motor unit ( MU) action potential trains. A surface sensor array is used to collect four channels of differentially amplified EMG signals. The decomposition is achieved by a set of algorithms that uses a specially developed knowledge-based Artificial Intelligence framework. In the automatic mode the accuracy ranges from 75 to 91{\%}. An Interactive Editor is used to increase the accuracy to > 97{\%} in signal epochs of about 30-s duration. The accuracy was verified by comparing the firings of action potentials from the EMG signals detected simultaneously by the surface sensor array and by a needle sensor. We have decomposed up to six MU action potential trains from the sEMG signal detected from the orbicularis oculi, platysma, and tibialis anterior muscles. However, the yield is generally low, with typically <= 5 MUs per contraction. Both the accuracy and the yield should increase as the algorithms are developed further. With this technique it is possible to investigate the behavior of MUs in muscles that are not easily studied by needle sensors. We found that the inverse relationship between the recruitment threshold and the firing rate previously reported for muscles innervated by spinal nerves is also present in the orbicularis oculi and the platysma, which are innervated by cranial nerves. However, these two muscles were found to have greater and more widespread values of firing rates than those of large limb muscles.},

abstract = {Light touch of a fingertip on an external stable surface greatly improves the postural stability of standing subjects. The hypothesis of the present work was that a vibrating surface could increase the effectiveness of fingertip signaling to the central nervous system (e.g., by a stochastic resonance mechanism) and hence improve postural stability beyond that achieved by light touch. Subjects stood quietly over a force plate while touching with their right index fingertip a surface that could be either quiescent or randomly vibrated at two low-level noise intensities. The vibratory noise of the contact surface caused a significant decrease in postural sway, as assessed by center of pressure measures in both time and frequency domains. Complementary experiments were designed to test whether postural control improvements were associated with a stochastic resonance mechanism or whether attentional mechanisms could be contributing. A full curve relating body sway parameters and different levels of vibratory noise resulted in a U-like function, suggesting that the improvement in sway relied on a stochastic resonance mechanism. Additionally, no decrease in postural sway was observed when the vibrating contact surface was attached to the subject's body, suggesting that no attentional mechanisms were involved. These results indicate that sensory cues obtained from the fingertip need not necessarily be associated with static contact surfaces to cause improvement in postural stability. A low-level noisy vibration applied to the contact surface could lead to a better performance of the postural control system.},

First published November 19, 2008; doi:10.1152/jn.90362.2008. Recordings of motor cortical activity typically show oscillations around 10 and 20 Hz; only those at 20 Hz are coherent with electromyograms (EMGs) of contralateral muscles. Experimental measurements of the phase difference between approximately 20-Hz oscillations in cortex and muscle are often difficult to reconcile with the known corticomuscular conduction delays. We investigated the generation of corticomuscular coherence further using a biophysically based computational model, which included a pool of motoneurons connected to motor units that generated EMGs. Delays estimated from the coherence phase-frequency relationship were sensitive to the width of the motor unit action potentials. In addition, the nonlinear properties of the motoneurons could produce complex, oscillatory phase-frequency relationships. This was due to the interaction of cortical inputs to the motoneuron pool with the intrinsic rhythmicity of the motoneurons; the response appeared more linear if the firing rate of motoneurons varied widely across the pool, such as during a strong contraction. The model was able to reproduce the smaller than expected delays between cortex and muscles seen in experiments. However, the model could not reproduce the constant phase over a frequency band sometimes seen in experiments, nor the lack of around 10-Hz coherence. Simple propagation of oscillations from cortex to muscle thus cannot completely explain the observed corticomuscular coherence.},

abstract = {Estimates of the number of motor unit action potential (MUAP)s appearing in the surface electromyogram (EMG) signal, which offers potentially valuable information about motor unit recruitment and firing rates, are likely to provide a more accurate reflection of the neural command to muscle than are current EMG quantification methods. In this paper, we show that the basic shapes of surface MUAPs recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle can ideally be represented by a small number of waveforms. On the basis of this, we seek to estimate the number of MUAPs present in standard surface EMG records, using template-matching techniques to identify MUAP occurrences. Our simulation study indicates that the performance of template-matching methods for MUAP number estimation is mainly constrained by the MUAP superposition in the signal, and the maximum number of MUAPs allowed in the signal for a good estimation is determined by the duration of MUAPs. To further explore this from experimental surface EMG signals, we compare the recordings from a selective multiple concentric ring electrode against those derived from a standard differential EMG electrode situated over the same muscle. We conclude that the ring surface electrode only slightly reduces the MUAP duration and the less MUAP superposition rate contained in the signal is mainly achieved by reducing the pick up area of the electrode. Using a template-matching method, although the number of MUAPs can be approximately estimated based on a very selective surface EMG recording at low force levels, the maximum number of MUAPs correctly estimated from the surface EMG is constrained by the MUAP duration.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occurrence of residual neuropathy and its self-reported health consequences in a population-based group of patients with Guillain-Barr{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} syndrome (GBS) and to characterize quantitatively the concomitant motor, sensory, and autonomic impairments. METHODS: Forty patients (mean age 46 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of GBS were studied a mean of 7 years (range 1 to 13 years) after the acute attack together with 40 healthy control subjects. The Dyck minimal criteria of neuropathy, the Neuropathy Symptom Score, the Neuropathy Disability Score, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) generic health questionnaire, isokinetic dynamometry at ankle and wrist, quantitative sensory testing of thresholds for vibration, cold, and pain, autonomic function tests, nerve conduction studies, and a summed Neuropathy Rank Sum Score (NRSS) were applied. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (48{\{}{\%}{\}}) had residual neuropathy, which was independent of follow-up time. The patients with GBS reported lower health status than control subjects on the SF-36 Physical Component Summary Scale (PCS; p = 0.01), and the PCS scores correlated with the NRSS (r = -0.41, p = 0.009). In patients with GBS, muscle strength at ankle dorsal flexion was reduced by 13.9{\{}{\%}{\}} (p = 0.001), sensory thresholds for vibration were increased in the foot (p < 0.05), and sensory thresholds for cold were increased in the hand and foot (p < 0.05), whereas autonomic functions and pain thresholds were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Residual neuropathy affecting large- and medium-sized myelinated fibers endures long after the acute attack of Guillain-Barr{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} syndrome in approximately half of all patients, leads to motor and sensory dysfunction, and shows a trend toward impairing self-reported physical health status.},

abstract = {Surface electromyographic (EMG) signal modelling is important for signal interpretation, testing of processing algorithms, detection system design and didactic purposes. Various surface EMG signal models have been proposed in the literature. This study focuses on the proposal of a method for modelling surface EMG signals, using either analytical or numerical descriptions of the volume conductor for space-invariant systems, and on the development of advanced models of the volume conductor by numerical approaches, accurately describing the volume conductor geometry and the conductivity, as mainly done in the past, but also the conductivity tensor of the muscle tissue. For volume conductors that are space-invariant in the direction of source propagation, the surface potentials generated by any source can be computed by one-dimensional convolutions, once the volume conductor transfer function has been derived (analytically or numerically). Conversely, more complex volume conductors require a complete numerical approach. In a numerical approach, the conductivity tensor of the muscle tissue should be matched with the fibre orientation. In some cases (e.g. multi-pinnate muscles), accurate description of the conductivity tensor can be very complex. A method for relating the conductivity tensor of the muscle tissue, to be used in a numerical approach, to the curve describing the muscle fibres is presented and applied to investigate representatively a bi-pinnate muscle with rectilinear and curvilinear fibres. The study thus proposes an approach for surface EMG signal simulation in space invariant systems, as well as new models of the volume conductor using numerical methods.},

abstract = {Modular organization in control architecture may underlie the versatility of human motor control; but the nature of the interface relating sensory input through task-selection in the space of performance variables to control actions in the space of the elemental variables is currently unknown. Our central question is whether the control architecture converges to a serial process along a single channel? In discrete reaction time experiments, psychologists have firmly associated a serial single channel hypothesis with refractoriness and response selection [psychological refractory period (PRP)]. Recently, we developed a methodology and evidence identifying refractoriness in sustained control of an external single degree-of-freedom system. We hypothesize that multi-segmental whole-body control also shows refractoriness. Eight participants controlled their whole body to ensure a head marker tracked a target as fast and accurately as possible. Analysis showed enhanced delays in response to stimuli with close temporal proximity to the preceding stimulus. Consistent with our preceding work, this evidence is incompatible with control as a linear time invariant process. This evidence is consistent with a single-channel serial ballistic process within the intermittent control paradigm with an intermittent interval of around 0.5 s. A control architecture reproducing intentional human movement control must reproduce refractoriness. Intermittent control is designed to provide computational time for an online optimization process and is appropriate for flexible adaptive control. For human motor control we suggest that parallel sensory input converges to a serial, single channel process involving planning, selection, and temporal inhibition of alternative responses prior to low dimensional motor output. Such design could aid robots to reproduce the flexibility of human control.},

abstract = {The intra-cortical local field potential (LFP) reflects a variety of electrophysiological processes including synaptic inputs to neurons and their spiking activity. It is still a common assumption that removing high frequencies, often above 300 Hz, is sufficient to exclude spiking activity from LFP activity prior to analysis. Conclusions based on such supposedly spike-free LFPs can result in false interpretations of neurophysiological processes and erroneous correlations between LFPs and behaviour or spiking activity. Such findings might simply arise from spike contamination rather than from genuine changes in synaptic input activity. Although the subject of recent studies, the extent of LFP contamination by spikes is unclear, and the fundamental problem remains. Using spikes recorded in the motor cortex of the awake monkey, we investigated how different factors, including spike amplitude, duration and firing rate, together with the noise statistic, can determine the extent to which spikes contaminate intra-cortical LFPs. We demonstrate that such contamination is realistic for LFPs with a frequency down to ∼10 Hz. For LFP activity below ∼10 Hz, such as movement-related potential, contamination is theoretically possible but unlikely in real situations. Importantly, LFP frequencies up to the (high-) gamma band can remain unaffected. This study shows that spike-LFP crosstalk in intra-cortical recordings should be assessed for each individual dataset to ensure that conclusions based on LFP analysis are valid. To this end, we introduce a method to detect and to visualise spike contamination, and provide a systematic guide to assess spike contamination of intra-cortical LFPs.},

Integrator circuits have been implicated in parametric working memory, decision making and motor control. Previous work has shown that stable integrator function can be achieved by an excitatory recurrent neural circuit, provided synaptic strengths are tuned with extreme precision (better than 1{\%} accuracy). Here we show that integrator circuits can function without fine tuning if the neuronal units have bistable properties. Two specific mechanisms of bistability are analyzed, one based on local recurrent excitation, and the other on the voltage-dependence of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) channel. Neither circuit requires fine tuning to perform robust integration, and the latter actually exploits the variability of neuronal conductances.},

abstract = {We examined the generally held belief that the postural control system is able to re-weight its available sensory inputs in order to optimize stance control in altered sensory environments. Our view is that previous accounts of sensory re-weighting provide only indirect evidence, which is subject to alternative explanations. The present results provide strong evidence for sensory re-weighting as the primary mechanism for changes observed in postural sway between conditions. Subjects were presented with small-amplitude, oscillatory visual and somatosensory stimuli at 0.20 and 0.28 Hz, respectively, in five conditions that manipulated the amplitudes of stimulus motion. Gain calculated in each trial with respect to each of the two stimuli was found to change systematically as stimulus motion amplitudes changed across condition. The observed pattern of gain rules out a constant-weight, linear account of posture and is consistent with the re-weighting hypothesis. Parameter fits of a third-order, linear stochastic model to postural sway trajectories in each condition showed that changes in gain across condition were primarily due to changes in coupling coefficients rather than changes in parameters that characterize the stability of the postural system. Visual gain was found to depend upon visual motion amplitude and touch gain was found to depend upon touch motion amplitude, indicating intra-modality dependencies. Visual gain also depended upon touch motion amplitude, indicating an inter-modality dependence. To our knowledge, simultaneous re-weighting of more than one sensory input has never been rigorously demonstrated. These techniques may be able to resolve the source of balance control deficits across populations with far more certainty than currently possible.},

abstract = {Neuronal networks in vivo are characterized by considerable spontaneous activity, which is highly complex and intrinsically generated by a combination of single-cell electrophysiological properties and recurrent circuits. As seen, for example, during waking compared with being asleep or under anesthesia, neuronal responsiveness differs, concomitant with the pattern of spontaneous brain activity. This pattern, which defines the state of the network, has a dramatic influence on how local networks are engaged by inputs and, therefore, on how information is represented. We review here experimental and theoretical evidence of the decisive role played by stochastic network states in sensory responsiveness with emphasis on activated states such as waking. From single cells to networks, experiments and computational models have addressed the relation between neuronal responsiveness and the complex spatiotemporal patterns of network activity. The understanding of the relation between network state dynamics and information representation is a major challenge that will require developing, in conjunction, specific experimental paradigms and theoretical frameworks.},

abstract = {1. Single motor unit activity was investigated in the extensor carpi radialis muscles during voluntary isometric contraction involving either the coactivation of the wrist agonist extensor muscles (wrist extension) or the coactivation of the wrist and finger antagonist extensor and flexor muscles (hand clenching). 2. The motor units were found to be activated at a similar level of motoneurone pool drive during both wrist extension and hand clenching, as indicated by the fact that the EMG activity at which they were recruited was practically the same in both cases (mean +/- S.D.: 20 +/- 26 and 21 +/- 25 mV, respectively). In addition, the net excitatory drive exerted on the motoneurones, as assessed from the mean interspike intervals, did not differ significantly between the two tasks (mean +/- S.D.: 104.57 +/- 17.24 and 103.01 +/- 16.26 ms, for wrist extension and hand clenching, respectively). 3. However, the discharge variability, in terms of the coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals, was slightly but significantly greater during hand clenching than during wrist extension (0.213 +/- 0.049 and 0.198 +/- 0.045, respectively). This increase involved all types of motor units, regardless of their contractile force. 4. We suggest that the greater motoneurone discharge variability observed during hand clenching may be attributable to an increase in the synaptic noise. This increase might be due to the activation of numerous afferent pathways mediating reciprocal interactions between antagonist motoneurone pools, as well as to the activation of hand cutaneous receptors that play a major role in the regulation of handling and gripping motor activities.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of feedback from large-diameter sensory fibers to the adaptation of soleus muscle activity after small ankle trajectory modifications during human walking. Small-amplitude and slow-velocity ankle dorsiflexion enhancements and reductions were applied during the stance phase of the gait cycle to mimic the normal variability of the ankle trajectory during walking. Patients with demyelination of large sensory fibers (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A and antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein neuropathy) and age-matched controls participated in this study. The patients had absent light-touch sense in the toes and feet and absent quadriceps and Achilles tendon reflexes, indicating functional loss of large sensory fibers. Moreover, their soleus stretch reflex response consisted of a single electromyographic (EMG) burst with delayed onset and longer duration (P < 0.01) than the short- and medium-latency reflex responses observed in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the soleus EMG gradually increased or decreased when the ankle dorsiflexion was, respectively, enhanced or reduced. In the patients, the soleus EMG increased during the dorsiflexion enhancements; however, the velocity sensitivity of this response was decreased compared with the healthy volunteers. When the dorsiflexion was reduced, the soleus EMG was unchanged. These results indicate that the enhancement of the soleus EMG is mainly sensitive to feedback from primary and secondary muscle spindle afferents and that the reduction may be mediated by feedback from the group Ib pathways. This study provides evidence for the role of sensory feedback in the continuous adaptation of the soleus activity during the stance phase of human walking.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the accuracy of Hill-type muscle models during movement. Hill-type models are ubiquitous in biomechanical simulations. They are attractive because of their computational simplicity and close relation to commonly measured experimental variables, but there have been surprisingly few experimental validations of these models during functionally relevant conditions. Our hypothesis was that model errors during movement are largest at the low motor unit firing rates most relevant to normal movement conditions. This hypothesis was evaluated in the cat soleus muscle activated either by electrical stimulation at physiological rates or via the crossed-extension reflex (CXR) thereby obtaining normal patterns of motor unit recruitment and rate modulation. These activation paradigms were applied during continuous movements approximately matched to locomotor length changes. The resulting muscle force was modeled using a common Hill model incorporating independent activation, tetanic length-tension and tetanic force-velocity properties. Errors for this model were greatest for stimulation rates between approximately 10-20Hz. Errors were especially large for muscles activated via the CXR, where most motor units appear to fire within this range. For large muscle excursions, such as those seen during normal locomotion, the errors for naturally activated muscle typically exceeded 50{\{}{\%}{\}}, supporting our hypothesis and indicating that the Hill model is not appropriate for these conditions. Subsequent analysis suggested that model errors were due to the common Hill model's inability to account for the coupling between muscle activation and force-velocity properties that is most prevalent at the low motor unit firing rates relevant to normal activation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of antibodies in neuromuscular junction disorders is well established with antibodies to acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase, and voltage-gated calcium channels. The diseases associated with these antibodies, myasthenia gravis and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, respond well to symptomatic treatments (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors) and to immunotherapies such as plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin, oral steroids, and steroid-sparing drugs. The role of the antibodies has been established by a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches. More recently, antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels have been identified in patients with autoimmune forms of acquired neuromyotonia. Over the last decade, antibodies to CNS membrane receptors or ion channels have begun to be identified and these antibodies define antibody-mediated CNS diseases that also respond to immunotherapies. SUMMARY: The paradigms gained from the study of the peripheral conditions has led to a better appreciation of the role of antibodies in neurological disorders and a growing recognition of their role in central nervous system (CNS) diseases.},

abstract = {We simulate reconstructed alpha-motoneurons (MNs) under physiological and morphological realistic parameters and compare the modeled reciprocal (REC) and recurrent (REN) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) containing voltage-dependent channels on the dendrites with the IPSPs of a passive MN model. Three distribution functions of the voltage-dependent channels on the dendrites are applied: a step function (ST) with uniform spatial dispersion; an exponential decay (ED) function, with channels with high density located proximal to the soma; and an exponential rise (ER) with a higher density of channels located distally. The excitatory and REN inhibitory inputs are located as a gaussian function on the dendrites, while the REC inhibitory synapses are located proximal to the soma. Our simulations generate four key results. (1) The distribution pattern of the voltage-dependent channels does not affect the IPSP peak, its time integral (TI), or its rate of rise (RR). However, the IPSP peak decreased in the presence of the active dendrites, while the EPSP peak increased. (2) Proximally located IPSP conductance produces greater IPSP peak, RR, and TI. (3) Increased duration of the IPSP produces greater RR and moderately increased TI and has a small effect on the peak amplitude. (4) The IPSP of both REC and REN models is specific to each MN: its amplitude is proportional to the MNs' input resistance, R-N; the increase of IPSP at the proximal location of the IPSP synapses is inversely related to R-N; and the effect of the IPSP conductance duration is insensitive to R-N.},

abstract = {The primary function of skeletal muscle is to produce force for postural control and movement. Although the contractile properties of the whole muscle are useful functional indicators, they do not accurately reflect the heterogeneity of the constituent motor units (MUs) and their changes in health and disease. However, data on the contractile properties of human MUs, in comparison to other animal species, are relatively sparse. This, in part, is due to greater methodological challenges of in vivo studies of MUs in the human. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the methods used in humans; to describe the normative data from different muscle groups; to discuss differences between data from healthy humans and other animal species; and, last, to characterize changes of the MU contractile properties in aging, disease, and in response to intervention. Because the spike-triggered averaging technique can only be used to study the twitch properties, other methods were subsequently developed to measure a wider range of contractile properties. Although there is general agreement between human data and those from other animal species, major differences do exist. Potential reasons for these discrepancies include true biological differences, but differences in the techniques used may also be responsible. Although limited, measurement of MU contractile properties in humans has provided insight into the changes associated with aging and motoneuronal diseases and provides a means of gauging their adaptive capacity for training and immobilization.

abstract = {We studied the synchronization of single units in macaque deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) with local field potentials (LFPs) in primary motor cortex (M1) bilaterally during performance of a precision grip task. Analysis was restricted to periods of steady holding, during which M1 oscillations are known to be strongest. Significant coherence between DCN units and M1 LFP oscillations bilaterally was seen at approximately 10-40 Hz (contralateral M1: 25/87 units; ipsilateral: 9/87 units). Averaged coherence between DCN units and contralateral M1 LFP showed a prominent approximately 17-Hz coherence peak and an average phase of approximately -pi/2 radians, implying that the DCN units fired around the time of maximal depolarization of M1 cells. The lack of a time delay between DCN and M1 activity suggests that the cerebellum and cortex may form a pair of phase coupled oscillators. Although coherence values were low (mean peak coherence, 0.018), we used a computational model to show that this probably resulted from the nonlinearity of spike generating mechanisms within the DCN. DCN unit discharge and DCN LFPs also showed significant coherence at approximately 10-40 Hz, with similarly low magnitude (mean peak coherence, 0.012). The average coherence phase was -2.5 radians for the 6- to 14-Hz range and -1.1 radians for the 17- to 41-Hz range, suggesting different frequency-specific underlying mechanisms. Finally, 4/40 pairs of simultaneously recorded DCN units showed a significant cross-correlation peak, and 16/40 pairs showed significant unit-unit coherence. The extensive oscillatory synchronization observed between cerebellum and motor cortex may have functional importance in sensorimotor processing.},

abstract = {Electromyographical analyses of pre-symptomatic motor unit loss in the SOD1 G93A transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have yielded contradictory findings as to the onset and time course. We recorded hindlimb muscle and motor unit isometric forces to determine motor unit number and size throughout the life span of the mice. Motor unit numbers in fast-twitch tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus and medial gastrocnemius muscles declined from 40 days of age, 50 days before reported overt symptoms and motoneuron loss. Motor unit numbers fell after overt symptoms in the slow-twitch soleus muscle. Muscle forces declined in parallel with motor unit numbers, indicating little or no functional compensation by sprouting. Early muscle-specific decline was due to selective preferential vulnerability of large, fast motor units, innervated by large motoneurons. Large motoneurons are hence the most vulnerable in ALS with die-back occurring prior to overt symptoms. We conclude that size of motoneurons, their axons, and their motor unit size are important determinants of motoneuron susceptibility in ALS.},

@article{Loeb2012,
abstract = {The notion that biological systems come to embody optimal solutions seems consistent with the competitive drive of evolution. It has been used to interpret many examples of sensorimotor behavior. It is attractive from the viewpoint of control engineers because it solves the redundancy problem by identifying the one optimal motor strategy out of many similarly acceptable possibilities. This perspective examines whether there is sufficient basis to apply the formal engineering tools of optimal control to a reductionist understanding of biological systems. For an experimental biologist, this translates into whether the theory of optimal control generates nontrivial and testable hypotheses that accurately predict novel phenomena, ideally at deeper levels of structure than the observable behavior. The methodology of optimal control is applicable when there is (i) a single, known cost function to be optimized, (ii) an invertible model of the plant, and (iii) simple noise interfering with optimal performance. None of these is likely to be true for biological organisms. Furthermore, their motivation is usually good-enough rather than globally optimal behavior. Even then, the performance of a biological organism is often much farther from optimal than the physical limits of its hardware because the brain is continuously testing the acceptable limits of performance as well as just performing the task. This perspective considers an alternative strategy called "good-enough" control, in which the organism uses trial-and-error learning to acquire a repertoire of sensorimotor behaviors that are known to be useful, but not necessarily optimal. This leads to a diversity of solutions that tends to confer robustness on the individual organism and its evolution. It is also more consistent with the capabilities of higher sensorimotor structures, such as cerebral cortex, which seems to be designed to classify and recall complex sets of information, thereby allowing the organism to learn from experience, rather than to compute new strategies online. Optimal control has been a useful metaphor for understanding some superficial aspects of motor psychophysics. Reductionists who want to understand the underlying neural mechanisms need to move on.},

abstract = {The energetic costs of action potential (AP) production constrain the evolution of neural codes and brain networks. Cellular-level estimates of AP-related costs are typically based on voltage-dependent Na+ currents that drive active transport by the Na+/K+ ATPase to maintain the Na+ and K+ ion concentration gradients necessary for AP production. However, these estimates of AP cost have not been verified at the organismal level. Electric signaling in the weakly electric fish Eigenmannia virescens requires that specialized cells in an electric organ generate APs with large Na+ currents at high rates (200–600 Hz). We measured these currents using a voltage-clamp protocol and then estimated the energetic cost at the cellular level using standard methods. We then used this energy-intensive signaling behavior to measure changes in whole-animal energetics for small changes in electric discharge rate. At low rates, the whole-animal measure of AP cost was similar to our cellular-level estimates. However, AP cost increased nonlinearly with increasing firing rates. We show, with a biophysical model, that this nonlinearity can arise from the increasing cost of maintaining AP amplitude at high rates. Our results confirm that estimates of energetic costs based on Na+ influx are appropriate for low baseline firing rates, but that extrapolating to high firing rates may underestimate true costs in cases in which AP amplitude does not decrease. Moreover, the trade-off between energetic cost and firing rate suggests an additional constraint on the evolution of high-frequency signaling in neuronal systems.},

The dynamic stiffness transfer functions relating ankle angular position to ankle torque were calculated. Stiffness gain was flat at low frequencies, had a resonant valley at intermediate frequencies, and rose to about 40 dB/decade at high frequencies. The mean ankle torque was held constant and the peak-to-peak amplitude of the displacement was varied. The low frequency gain and resonant frequency decreased progressively with increases in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the displacement. The dynamic stiffness was well described by a linear, second-order transfer function having inertial, viscous and elastic terms. Estimates of the inertial parameter were independent of the displacement amplitude but the viscous and elastic parameters decreased with increases in displacement amplitude.},

abstract = {A critical step in improving our understanding of the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is to identify the factors contributing to the alterations in the excitability of motoneurons and assess their individual contributions. Here we investigated the early alterations in the passive electrical and morphological properties of neonatal spinal motoneurons that occur by 10 d after birth, long before disease onset. We identified some of the factors contributing to these alterations, and estimated their individual contributions. To achieve this goal, we undertook a computer simulation analysis using realistic morphologies of reconstructed wild-type (WT) and mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (mSOD1) motoneurons. Ion channel parameters of these models were then tuned to match the experimental data on electrical properties obtained from these same motoneurons. We found that the reduced excitability of mSOD1 models was accompanied with decreased specific membrane resistance by approximately 25{\{}{\%}{\}} and efficacy of synaptic inputs (slow and fast) by 12-22{\{}{\%}{\}}. Linearity of summation of synaptic currents was similar to WT. We also assessed the contribution of the alteration in dendritic morphology alone to this decreased excitability and found that it reduced the input resistance by 10{\{}{\%}{\}} and the efficacy of synaptic inputs by 7-15{\{}{\%}{\}}. Our results were also confirmed in models with dendritic active conductances. Our simulations indicated that the alteration in passive electrical properties of mSOD1 models resulted from concurrent alterations in their morphology and membrane biophysical properties, and consequently altered the motoneuronal dendritic processing of synaptic inputs. These results clarify new aspects of spinal motoneurons malfunction in ALS.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the variability of EMG signal envelope with electrode location during gait. Surface EMG signals were recorded from 10 healthy subjects from the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), and soleus (SO) muscles. From TA, PL, GL and GM, signals were acquired using a two-dimensional grid of 4 x 3 electrodes (10 x 15 mm in size, as used in most gait laboratories) with 20-mm interelectrode distance in both directions. A similar grid of 3 x 3 electrodes was used for SO. EMG envelope was characterized by its peak value, area after normalization by the peak value, and time instant corresponding to the maximum. The maximum relative change in peak value with electrode location, expressed as a percentage of the peak value in the central location, was (mean +/- SD) 31 +/- 18{\%} for TA, 29 +/- 13{\%} for PL, 25 +/- 1 15{\%} for GL, 14 +/- 8{\%} for GM, and 26 +/- 14{\%} for SO. The maximum relative change in area was 29 +/- 13{\%} for TA, 73 +/- 40{\%} for PL, 31 +/- 23{\%} for GL, 35 +/- 20{\%} for GM, 20 +/- 13{\%} for SO, and in the position of maximum, computed as distance from the maximum position in the central channel, it was 5 +/- 10{\%} of the gait cycle for TA, 26 +/- 16{\%} for PL, 3 +/- 2{\%} for GL, 3 +/- 1{\%} for GM, 3 +/- 3{\%} for SO. A crosstalk index, defined on the basis of the expected intervals of muscle activation for healthy subjects, indicated that estimated crosstalk was present between TA and PL, in an amount which depended on electrode location. It was concluded that the estimate of muscle activation intensity during gait from surface EMG is variable with location of the electrodes while timing of muscle activity is more robust to electrode displacement and can be reliably extracted in those cases in which crosstalk is limited. These results are valid for healthy subjects, where the level of muscular activity during gait is much lower than maximum. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A comparison of the average MU twitch torque with that of the muscle allowed an estimate of about 300 MUs in the Tibialis anterior. A positive linear relationship was recorded between the MU twitch torque and the recruitment threshold. The mean minimal and maximal discharge frequencies of MUs were 8.4 +/- 3.0 Hz and 33.2 +/- 14.7 Hz, respectively.

@article{Raikova2002,
abstract = {The applicability of static optimization (and, respectively, frequently used objective functions) for prediction of individual muscle forces for dynamic conditions has often been discussed. Some of the problems are whether time-independent objective functions are suitable, and how to incorporate muscle physiology in models. The present paper deals with a twofold task: (1) implementation of hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) based on the properties of the motor units (MUs) twitches, and using multi-objective, time-dependent optimization functions; and (2) comparison of the results of the HGA application with those obtained through static optimization with a criterion "minimum of a weighted sum of the muscle forces raised to the power of n". HGA and its software implementation are presented. The moments of neural stimulation of all MUs are design variables coding the problem in the terms of HGA. The main idea is in using genetic operations to find these moments, so that the sum of MUs twitches satisfies the imposed goals (required joint moments, minimal sum of muscle forces, ete.). Elbow flexion and extension movements with different velocities are considered as proper illustration. It is supposed that they are performed by two extensor muscles and three flexor muscles. The results show that HGA is a suitable means for precise investigation of motor control. Many experimentally observed phenomena (such as antagonistic co-contraction, three-phasic behavior of the muscles during fast movements) can find their explanation by the properties of the MUs twitches. Static optimization is also able to predict three-phasic behavior and could be used as practicable and computationally inexpensive method for total estimation of the muscle forces.

abstract = {Since the first descriptions of sensorimotor rhythms by Berger (1929) and by Jasper and Penfield (1949), the potential role of beta oscillations ({\{}{\~{}}{\}} 13-30 Hz) in the brain has been intensely investigated. We start this review by showing that experimental studies in humans and monkeys have reached a consensus on the facts that sensorimotor beta power is low during movement, transiently increases after movement end (the "beta rebound") and tonically increases during object grasping. Recently, a new surge of studies exploiting more complex sensorimotor tasks including multiple events, such as instructed delay tasks, reveal novel characteristics of beta oscillatory activity. We therefore proceed by critically reviewing also this literature to understand whether modulations of beta oscillations in task epochs other than those during and after movement are consistent across studies, and whether they can be reconciled with a role for beta oscillations in sensorimotor transmission. We indeed find that there are additional processes that also strongly affect sensorimotor beta oscillations, such as visual cue anticipation and processing, fitting with the view that beta oscillations reflect heightened sensorimotor transmission beyond somatosensation. However, there are differences among studies, which may be interpreted more readily if we assume multiple processes, whose effects on the overall measured beta power overlap in time. We conclude that beta oscillations observed in sensorimotor cortex may serve large-scale communication between sensorimotor and other areas and the periphery. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A model is presented to study and quantify the contribution of all available sensory information to human standing based on optimal estimation theory. In the model, delayed sensory information is integrated in such a way that a best estimate of body orientation is obtained. The model approach agrees with the present theory of the goal of human balance control. The model is not based on purely inverted pendulum body dynamics, but rather on a three-link segment model of a standing human on a movable support base. In addition, the model is non-linear and explicitly addresses the problem of multisensory integration and neural time delays. A predictive element is included in the controller to compensate for time delays, necessary to maintain erect body orientation. Model results of sensory perturbations on total body sway closely resemble experimental results. Despite internal and external perturbations, the controller is able to stabilise the model of an inherently unstable standing human with neural time delays of 100 ms. It is concluded, that the model is capable of studying and quantifying multisensory integration in human stance control. We aim to apply the model in (1) the design and development of prostheses and orthoses and (2) the diagnosis of neurological balance disorders.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that pulse-widths of 0.5-1.0 ms should be used to evoke H-reflexes in humans; however, the influence of pulse-width on H-reflex recruitment over a range of stimulus intensities has not been well characterized. We constructed soleus H-reflex vs. M-wave recruitment curves using 50, 200, 500, and 1000 mu s pulses in 12 subjects. In contrast to previous findings, changing the pulse-width did not significantly alter maximal H-reflex (H-max,) or M-wave (M-max) amplitudes or H-max/M-max ratios. In fact, the 1000 mu s pulses resulted in larger H-reflexes when the M-wave was 5{\%} M-max; smaller M-waves at H-max; and lower H-reflex thresholds compared with 50 mu s pulses. These differences reflect a leftward shift in the H-reflex vs. M-wave recruitment curve when using wide vs. narrow pulses and, combined with no change in the H-max/M-max ratios, suggest that factors other than antidromic collision in motor axons limit H-max. These results support the idea that 1000 mu s pulses should be used to evoke H-reflexes and suggest that wider pulses may be beneficial to generate contractions with a greater reflex contribution when using neuromuscular stimulation for rehabilitation.},

Simulations can also be used to identify the sources of pathological movement and establish a scientific basis for treatment planning. We have developed a freely available, open-source software system (OpenSim) that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal structures and create dynamic simulations of a wide variety of movements. We are using this system to simulate the dynamics of individuals with pathological gait and to explore the biomechanical effects of treatments. OpenSim provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through a multi-institutional collaboration. Developing software that enables a concerted effort from many investigators poses technical and sociological challenges. Meeting those challenges will accelerate the discovery of principles that govern movement control and improve treatments for individuals with movement pathologies.},

abstract = {Force fluctuations during steady contractions of multiple agonist muscles may be influenced by the relative contribution of force by each muscle. The purpose of the study was to compare force fluctuations during steady contractions performed with the plantar flexor muscles in different knee positions. Nine men (25.8 +/- 5.1 years) performed steady contractions of the plantar flexor muscles in the knee-flexed and knee-extended (greater involvement of the gastrocnemii muscles) positions. The maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force was 32{\{}{\%}{\}} greater in the knee-extended position compared with the knee-flexed position. The target forces were 2.5-10{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC force in the respective position. The amplitude of electromyogram in the medial gastrocnemius muscle was greater in the knee-extended position (10.50 +/- 9.80{\{}{\%}{\}}) compared with the knee-flexed position (1.26 +/- 1.15{\{}{\%}{\}}, P < 0.01). The amplitude of electromyogram in the soleus muscle was not influenced by the knee position. The amplitude of electromyogram in the lateral gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles was marginal and unaltered with knee position. At the same force (in Newtons), the standard deviation of force was lower in the knee-extended position compared with the knee-flexed position. These results indicate that force fluctuations during plantar flexion are attenuated with greater involvement of the medial gastrocnemius muscle.},

Here, we introduce an electrochemical neuroprosthesis and a robotic postural interface designed to encourage supraspinally mediated movements in rats with paralyzing lesions. Despite the interruption of direct supraspinal pathways, the cortex regained the capacity to transform contextual information into task-specific commands to execute refined locomotion. This recovery relied on the extensive remodeling of cortical projections, including the formation of brainstem and intraspinal relays that restored qualitative control over electrochemically enabled lumbosacral circuitries. Automated treadmill-restricted training, which did not engage cortical neurons, failed to promote translesional plasticity and recovery. By encouraging active participation under functional states, our training paradigm triggered a cortex-dependent recovery that may improve function after similar injuries in humans.},

Morphological properties of the ulnar and the MG nerves were also studied. No significant difference was found in the mean number of the ulnar motoneurons between the two age groups, while that of MG motoneurons was significantly less in aged animals. A decrease in the number of myelinated fibers (including both afferent and efferent fibers) in the ulnar nerves was less than that in the MG nerves, although the age difference was not significant in either of the nerves. Soma atrophy of aged motoneurons was found in both MG and ulnar motor nuclei. The mean fascicular areas and myelinated fiber diameters were significantly increased in both the MG and the ulnar nerves in aged rats, but these were less pronounced for the ulnar nerve. The results indicate that most ulnar motoneurons, unlike MG motoneurons, survive at least to the age of 27 months. Morphological changes in the peripheral nerves were also less for the ulnar nerve than for the MG nerve. Thus, we conclude that the effects of aging on motoneurons and peripheral nerves innervating MG muscle of the hindlimb are greater than those innervating forelimb muscles.},

In addition, the terminal segment for each of these two MUAPs contained a late far-field potential with a mean duration of 23.8 +/- 4.1 ms. Computer simulations of MUAPs suggest that this long-duration positive far-field mirrors the true morphology of the intracellular action potential (IAP), which is monophasic positive, possessing a terminal repolarization phase approaching 30 ms. This investigation suggests that the MUAP's physiologic duration is directly proportional to the muscle fiber length and the IAP's duration, which becomes manifest as a positive far-field potential when the IAP encounters the musculotendinous junction and slowly dissipates. The leading/trailing dipole model is used to explain qualitatively this study's quantitative clinical and computer simulation findings. (C) 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Ln the presence of the monoamines serotonin and norepinephrine, spinal motoneurons can exhibit bistable behavior, in which a brief period of excitatory input evokes prolonged self-sustained firing. A brief inhibitory input returns the cell to the quiescent state. To determine whether motoneurons differ in their capacity for bistable behavior, intracellular recordings were obtained in the decerebrate cat preparation. To enhance the Likelihood of encountering bistable behavior; the noradrenergic alpha(1) agonist methoxamine was applied to the ventral surface of the cord. The capacity of the cells to produce bistable behavior was assessed from the duration of self-sustained firing evoked by a brief (1.5 s) excitatory synaptic input from muscle spindle la afferents. About 35{\%} (17 of 49) of the cells produced steady self-sustained firing for >3 s and were considered fully bistable. The other 32 cells (similar to 65{\%}) were partially bistable, with self-sustained firing lasting <3 s. Fully bistable cells tended to have lower current thresholds for spike initiation and slower axonal conduction velocities than did partially bistable cells. This suggests that fully bistable motoneurons innervate fatigue resistant muscle fibers. The frequency-currrent (F-I) relations of the motoneurons were characterized with slow triangular current ramps. Fully bistable cells displayed an acceleration in firing rare immediately on initiation of rhythmic firing. The F-l gain after completion of the acceleration was positive. Fully bistable cells also displayed a hysteresis in the current level for firing threshold with the ascending threshold occurring at substantially higher current level than the descending one. Additionally. these current thresholds usually were centered about zero current, so that the ascending current threshold was positive while the descending current threshold was negative. This negative offset meant that fully bistable cells could exhibit tonic firing without depolarizing injected current. Partially bistable cells exhibited very different F-I characteristics. Firing rate acceleration was just as large as in fully bistable cells but did not occur until well above the current level needed to initiate rhythmic firing. F-I gain after acceleration was negative, there was little to no hysteresis between the ascending and descending firing thresholds, and both thresholds were above the zero current level. These proper-ties of partially bistable cells suggest their functional role is in tasks requiring relatively brief, high forces. The low thresholds of fully bistable cells mean they will be readily recruited in low force tasks like posture, where their prolonged self-sustained firing would be advantageous.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to expand a model of motor unit recruitment and rate coding (30) to simulate the adjustments that occur during a fatiguing contraction. The major new components of the model were the introduction of time-varying parameters for motor unit twitch force, recruitment, discharge rate, and discharge variability, and a control algorithm that estimates the net excitation needed by the motoneuron pool to maintain a prescribed target force. The fatigue-induced changes in motor unit activity in the expanded model are a function of changes in the metabolite concentrations that were computed with a compartment model of the intra- and extracellular spaces. The model was validated by comparing the simulation results with data available from the literature and experimentally recorded in the present study during isometric contractions of the first dorsal interosseus muscle. The output of the model was able to replicate a number of experimental findings, including the time to task failure for a range of target forces, the changes in motor unit discharge rates, the skewness and kurtosis of the interspike interval distributions, discharge variability, and the discharge characteristics of newly recruited motor units. The model output provides an integrative perspective of the adjustments during fatiguing contractions that are difficult to measure experimentally.},

In particular, the accurate simulation of a large number of synaptic inputs in wide-scale network models may result in a computationally highly demanding process. We present a generalized consolidating algorithm to simulate efficiently a large number of synaptic inputs of the same kind (excitatory or inhibitory), converging on an isopotential compartment, independently modeling each synaptic current by a generic n-state Markov model characterized by piece-wise constant transition probabilities. We extend our findings to a class of simplified phenomenological descriptions of synaptic transmission that incorporate higher-order dynamics, such as short-term facilitation, depression, and synaptic plasticity.},

What neural code is used to represent sensory information in vestibular pathways? How do the interactions between the organism and the environment shape encoding? How is self-motion information processing adjusted to meet the needs of specific tasks?

abstract = {We hypothesized that multi-sensory processing at the central nervous system (CNS) in human postural control can be described using an optimal estimator model. The estimates on body dynamics from multi-sensory signals contain sensory noise, transmission delays, and process disturbances. The state estimates approximate actual body movement. Erroneous estimates degrade the performance of feedback control and could cause a loss of balance if distorted severely. To test the hypothesis, we examined the frequency response of a visually-induced postural sway with stimulus frequency ranging from 0.075 to 1Hz and established an optimal estimator model. Two healthy young (33yrs +/- 1) subjects stood on a force platform located 1.25m behind a projection screen with their arms crossed over their chests. They were asked to maintain an upright posture against the sinusoidal visual field stimuli. Each sinusoidal visual stimulus was generated by a projector for 200secs in pitch direction with a maximum pitch angle of 20degrees. Kinematics data was recorded to calculate the frequency response function of the center of mass (COM). There were three components in the modeling procedure: a biornechanical model of body and sensor dynamics, a linear feedback control model to stabilize the biornechanical model, and a state estimator to estimate body dynamic states based on multi-sensory outputs. We modeled the sensor dynamics of the semicircular canal, otolth, vision, and muscle spindles at the ankle and hip joint. We used the Kalman filter and linear quadratic regulator to determine feedback gains. Results showed that the frequency response function of a visually-induced postural sway decreased as stimulus frequency increased, and this low-pass filtering characteristic with an approximate cutoff frequency of 0.2Hz was also simulated by the postural feedback control model with optimal estimator. Low-pass filtering characteristics of the frequency response are mainly due to body and sensor dynamics, which show reduced responses for high frequency stimulus. The Kalman filter represents that the CNS utilizes redundant sensory information in a way that minimizes discrepancies between actual body dynamics and estimated body dynamics based on sensory output and an internal model. The results suggest that the CNS may make use of an internal representation of body dynamics, and can integrate sensory information in an optimal way to best estimate human postural responses.},

abstract = {Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) located in the skeletal muscles provide the central nervous system with information about muscle tension. The ensemble firing of all GTO receptors in the muscle has been hypothesized to represent a reliable measure of the whole muscle force but the precision and accuracy of that information are largely unknown because it is impossible to record activity simultaneously from all GTOs in a Muscle. In this Study, we combined a new mathematical model of force sampling and transduction in individual GTOs with various models of motor unit (MU) organization and recruitment simulating various normal, pathological and neural prosthetic conditions. Our study Suggests that in the intact muscle the ensemble GTO activity accurately encodes force information according to a nonlinear, monotonic relationship that has its steepest slope for low force levels and tends to saturate at the highest force levels. The relationship between the aggregate GTO activity and whole muscle tension under some pathological conditions is similar to one seen in the intact muscle during rapidly modulated, phasic excitation of the motor pool (typical for many natural movements) but quite different when the muscle is activated slowly or held at a given force level. Substantial deviations were also observed during simulated functional electrical stimulation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test a new problem-based learning (PBL) method to see if it reinvigorated the learning experience. METHOD: A new PBL format called PBL 2.0, which met for 90 min two times per week, was introduced in 2009 into an 11-week integrated neuroscience course. One hundred second-year medical students, divided into 10 groups of 10, who had completed their first year of medical school using a traditional PBL format, participated in PBL 2.0. Students were prohibited from using computers during the first session. Learning objectives were distributed at the end of the first day to the small groups, and students were assigned to pairs/trios responsible for leading an interactive discussion on specific learning objectives the following day. Student-led 'lectures' were prohibited. All students were responsible for learning all of the learning objectives so that they could participate in their discussions. RESULTS: One hundred and six students were surveyed and 98 submitted answers (92{\%} response). The majority of groups adhered to the new PBL method. Students invested more time preparing the learning objectives. Students indicated that the level of interaction among students increased. The majority of students preferred the new PBL format. CONCLUSIONS: PBL 2.0 was effective in increasing student interaction and promoting increased learning.},

abstract = {1. During maintained ankle extension with background torques ranging from 0 to 70 N.m, the ankle extensors were stretched by a 5-degrees rotation of the ankle joint. Maximal stretch velocity was 170-degrees/s. Regression analysis of simultaneous measurements of total torque and needle and surface electromyograms (EMG) from the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles showed that the soleus muscle generates about two-thirds of the maximal torque (approximately 120 Nm) with the subjects in sitting position. In addition, it was found that there is considerable cross talk between the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles when EMGs are recorded by surface electrodes. 2. The soleus EMG response to stretch began with a "phasic" response (latency 41 +/- 4 ms, mean +/- SD), consisting of two peaks, labeled M1 and M2. The phasic response ended 120-140 ms after stretch onset and was followed by a period of reduced EMG activity, ending at 170-210 ms. After this "silent period," a smaller "tonic" response was seen. The phasic responses of the soleus muscle were much larger than the corresponding responses in the anterior tibial muscle. In contrast, the tonic responses were comparable in the soleus and anterior tibial muscles. 3. The amplitudes of the phasic M1 and M2 responses were independent of the level of the background contraction. This disagrees with the "automatic gain principle," according to which the amplitudes of M1 and M2 should increase proportionally with the background EMG. In contrast to the phasic responses, the amplitude of the tonic EMG response, measured 200-400 ms after stretch onset, followed the automatic gain principle. 4. Nonreflex stiffness was measured during electrical stimulation of the soleus nerve. In the relaxed extensor muscles, approximately two-thirds of a total stiffness of 1.4 N.m/deg arose from the reflex-mediated stiffness when measured 200 ms after stretch onset. When measured 400 ms after stretch onset, approximately one-third of a total stiffness of 1.2 N.m/degree arose from the reflex-mediated stiffness. At a background torque of 70 N.m, the reflex-mediated stiffness only contributed with approximately 10{\%} of the total stiffness. The total stiffness at this contraction level was 5.8 and 5.2 N.m/degree 200 and 400 ms after stretch onset. 5. We conclude that the total stiffness is sufficient to play an important role, both during active movement and during postural tasks, and that the ankle extensors have a larger reflex-mediated stiffness than the ankle flexors at low contraction levels, but interestingly a less important reflex component at intermediate levels of contraction. 6. Reflex-mediated torque increments were predicted from the phasic and tonic EMG responses. The reflex-mediated torque increments predicted from the tonic EMG response agreed with the measured torque increments, whereas those predicted from the phasic EMG responses were approximately 3 times larger than the measured torque increments. We suggest that the discrepancy arises from the high degree of synchronization of the phasic EMG response, which is characteristic for the ankle extensors, but not for the flexors.},

abstract = {1. Thresholds for the perception of postural sway induced by gentle perturbations were determined for five normal standing subjects. In this context we understand 'perception' to mean 'able to give a subjective report'. The thresholds for the perception of movements that were equivalent to sway in velocity and amplitude were determined when the available sensory input was limited to only one, or a pair, of the vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive systems. To examine vestibular inputs alone, vision was excluded and the whole body was moved with the ankles in a fixed position. To examine visual inputs alone, the body was kept stationary and a 'room' was moved around the subjects to simulate the relative visual-field movement that occurs during standing. To limit the available sensory input to proprioception from the legs, subjects were held stationary and balanced a load that was equivalent to their own body using their ankles. In this situation, perturbations were applied to the 'equivalent body' and these could only be perceived from the resulting ankle movements. Thresholds for perceiving ankle movements were also determined in the same posture, but with the leg muscles bearing no load. 2. The thresholds for the perception of sway during standing were very small, typically 0.003 rad at a velocity of 0.001 rad s(-1), and even smaller movements were perceived as the mean velocity of the sway increased up to 0.003 rad s(-1). No difference was found between the thresholds for perceiving forward sway and backward sway. Eye closure during standing did not affect the threshold for perceiving sway. 3. When sensory input was limited to proprioception from the legs, the thresholds for the perception of passive ankle movements were equivalent to the thresholds for the perception of sway during standing with all sensory inputs available. When the leg muscles were relaxed, the thresholds for perceiving ankle movements increased approximately twofold. 4. The visual thresholds for perceiving movement were higher than the proprioceptive thresholds at slower velocities of movement, but there was no difference at higher velocities. 5. Both the proprioceptive and visual thresholds were sufficiently small to allow perception of the sway that was recorded when the subjects stood normally in a relaxed manner. In contrast, the vestibular thresholds were an order of magnitude greater than the visual or proprioceptive thresholds and above the largest sway movements that were recorded during normal standing. 6. When more than one sensory modality was available for perception, subjects performed at a level that was equivalent to the sensory modality that had the greater acuity. 7. These findings indicate that, during normal standing, proprioceptive inputs from the legs provide the most sensitive means of perceiving postural sway. At higher, but not lower, velocities within the range of velocities of normal sway, visual inputs provided similarly sensitive means of perceiving sway. However, large disturbances of posture would be required before vestibular mechanisms could provide perceptual information about body sway, and the present study indicates that the vestibular system plays no part in the perception of sway during normal standing.},

It was suggested that the behavior of MG and SOL during twitch contraction is practically similar in spite of their known physiological and architectural differences, and that the time-course of twitch torque is greatly influenced by the changes in the length of muscle fascicles and tendinous tissues.

abstract = {This review describes methods for interfacing motor neurons from muscle recordings and their applications in studies on the neural control of movement and in the design of technologies for neurorehabilitation. After describing methods for accessing the neural drive to muscles in vivo in humans, we discuss the mechanisms of transmission of synaptic input into motor neuron output and of force generation. The synaptic input received by a motor neuron population is largely common among motor neurons. This allows linear transmission of the input and a reduced dimensionality of control by the central nervous system. Force is generated by low-pass filtering the neural signal sent to the muscle. These concepts on neural control of movement are used for the development of neurorehabilitation technologies, which are discussed with representative examples on movement replacement, restoration, and neuromodulation. It is concluded that the analysis of the output of spinal motor neurons from muscle signals provides a unique means for understanding the neural coding of movement in vivo in humans and thus for reproducing this code artificially with the aim of restoring lost or impaired motor functions.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to determine the in vivo passive mechanical properties, including the length below the slack length, of the gastrocnemius muscle (GAS) belly in humans. Transverse ultrasound images of the medial head of the GAS were taken in 11 subjects during passive knee extension from 80 degrees to 5 degrees with a constant ankle joint angle of 10 degrees (0 degrees is the neutral ankle position: positive values for dorsiflexion). The change in passive ankle joint moment (Mp), which is produced only by the GAS length change, was also measured during passive knee extension. The onset of Mp during passive knee extension was found to be 43 +/- 8 degrees (mean +/- SD) when the baseline of the Mp was set at the average Mp in the range of 55-60 degrees where the Mp was almost constant (SD < 0.03 Nm). At this onset, the muscle fascicle length of the GAS (Lf) was 46 +/- 7 mm (slack length; Lfs). Lf at 80 degrees was 6 4 mm (13 +/- 6{\%}) less than the Lfs, and Lf at 5 degrees was 12 5 mm (27 +/- 11{\%}) greater than the Lfs. The passive force-resisting compression of the GAS did not produce a dorsiflexion moment in the joint angle range adopted. The passive ankle joint moment increased linearly with Lf (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.85-0.96), and the slopes of the relationships between Lf and Mp, and between the relative Lf to Us and Mp were 0.093 +/- 0.038 Nm/mrn and 0.043 +/- 0.021 Nm/{\%}Lfs. The findings of the present study can be implemented in musculoskeletal modeling, which would provide a more accurate evaluation of the passive mechanical properties of muscle during movement.

abstract = {The hamster is a valuable biological model for physiological investigation. Despite the obvious importance of the integration of cardiorespiratory and muscular system function, little information is available regarding hamster muscle fiber type and oxidative capacity, both of which are key determinants of muscle function. The purpose of this investigation was to measure immunohistochemically the relative composition and size of muscle fibers composed of types I, IIA, IIX, and IIB fibers in hamster skeletal muscle. The oxidative capacity of each muscle was also assessed by measuring citrate synthase activity. Twenty-eight hindlimb, respiratory, and facial muscles or muscle parts from adult (144147 g bw) male Syrian golden hamsters (n=3) were dissected bilaterally, weighed, and frozen for immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis. Combining data from all 28 muscles analyzed, type I fibers made up 5{\%} of the muscle mass, type IIA fibers 16{\%}, type IIX fibers 39{\%}, and type IIB fibers 40{\%}. Mean fiber cross-sectional area across muscles was 1665 328 mum(2) for type I fibers, 1900 +/- 417 mum(2) for type IIA fibers, 3230 +/- 784 mum(2) for type IN fibers, and 4171 +/- 864 mum(2) for type IIB fibers. Citrate synthase activity was most closely related to the population of type IIA fibers (r=0.68, p<0.0001) and was in the rank order of type IIA > I > IN > IIB. These data demonstrate that hamster skeletal muscle is predominantly composed of type IIB and IN fibers.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish a nerve lesion model to compare serial electrophysiological and functional outcome measures with histological findings. The relative significance of the parameters in lesions of diverse severity, the time course of recovery, and the tools for serial longitudinal studies after nerve lesions were studied in rats. We compared weekly electrophysiological and functional studies for 100 or 150 days in rats after crush or section/suture of the sciatic nerve at midthigh level. Finally, tibial nerves were taken for histology. We confirmed that recovery was faster and more complete in nerves regenerating after crush than after section, irrespective of method of evaluation. Furthermore, continuous maturational changes occurred in control nerves, and such continuous growth-related changes should be taken into account when evaluating maturational changes during nerve regeneration. A lack of correlation between evaluation methods supports that functional, morphological, and physiological parameters show different aspects of the recovery process after nerve lesions, and that these outcome measures should be included separately in therapeutic studies.

abstract = {The reduction in vibrotactile sensitivity in the fingertip is assumed to be associated with the exposure of the tissues to repetitive, non-physiological strains during dynamic loading. Experimental results demonstrated that the magnitude of a vibration-induced temporary threshold shift is dependent upon the vibration frequency of both the exposure and testing stimuli. In the present study, the frequency-dependent strain imposed on cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues of the fingertip is analyzed theoretically using a finite element model. The proposed fingertip model is two-dimensional and includes major anatomical substructures: skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and nail. The soft tissues (skin and subcutaneous tissues) were assumed to be nonlinearly elastic and viscoelastic, while the bone and nail were considered as linearly elastic. Simulations were performed for the contact between the fingertip and a flat surface for four different pre-compressions (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm). The frequency-dependent distributions of the dynamic strain magnitudes in the soft tissues were investigated. The model predictions indicated that the vibration exposure at a frequency range from 63 to 250 Hz will induce excessive dynamic strain in the deep zone of the finger tissues, effectively inhibiting the high-frequency mechanoreceptors; while the vibration exposure at low frequency (less than 31.5 Hz) tends to induce excessive dynamic strain in superficial layer in the tissues, inhibiting the low-frequency mechanoreceptors. These theoretical predictions are consistent with the experimental observations in literature. The proposed model can be used to predict the responses of the soft tissues in different depths to vibration exposures, providing valuable information and data that are essential for improving vibrotactile perception tests.},

abstract = {We investigate whether the muscle response evoked by an electrically induced vestibular perturbation during standing is related to congruent sensory and motor signals. A robotic platform that simulated the mechanics of a standing person was used to manipulate the relationship between the action of the calf muscles and the movement of the body. Subjects braced on top of the platform with the ankles sway referenced to its motion were required to balance its simulated body-like load by modulating ankle plantar-flexor torque. Here, afferent signals of body motion were congruent with the motor command to the calf muscles to balance the body. Stochastic vestibular stimulation (±4 mA, 0-25 Hz) applied during this task evoked a biphasic response in both soleus muscles that was similar to the response observed during standing for all subjects. When the body was rotated through the same motion experienced during the balancing task, a small muscle response was observed in only the right soleus and in only half of the subjects. However, the timing and shape of this response did not resemble the vestibular-evoked response obtained during standing. When the balancing task was interspersed with periods of computer-controlled platform rotations that emulated the balancing motion so that subjects thought that they were constantly balancing the platform, coherence between the input vestibular stimulus and soleus electromyogram activity decreased significantly (P < 0.05) during the period when plantar-flexor activity did not affect the motion of the body. The decrease in coherence occurred at 175 ms after the transition to computer-controlled motion, which subjects did not detect until after 2247 ms (Confidence Interval 1801, 2693), and then only half of the time. Our results indicate that the response to an electrically induced vestibular perturbation is organised in the absence of conscious perception when sensory feedback is congruent with the underlying motor behaviour.},

abstract = {The neuromuscular system is inherently noisy and joint impedance may serve to filter this noise. In the present experiment, we investigated whether individuals modulate joint impedance to meet spatial accuracy demands. Twelve subjects were instructed to make rapid, time constrained, elbow extensions to three differently sized targets. Some trials (20 out of 140 for each target, randomly assigned) were perturbed mechanically at 75{\{}{\%}{\}} of movement amplitude. Inertia, damping and stiffness were estimated from the torque and angle deviation signal using a forward simulation and optimization routine. Increases in endpoint accuracy were not always reflected in a decrease in trajectory variability. Only in the final quarter of the trajectory the variability decreased as target width decreased. Stiffness estimates increased significantly with accuracy constraints. Damping estimates only increased for perturbations that were initially directed against the movement direction. We concluded that joint impedance modulation is one of the strategies used by the neuromuscular system to generate accurate movements, at least during the final part of the movement.},

abstract = {Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was introduced in 1971 as a way of providing an objective and meaningful estimate of axon loss in diseases affecting the motor system. Over the last 30 years, different methods of MUNE have been proposed, with each having specific strengths and limitations. The goal of this paper is to review the available methods, and to present data generated using MUNE in a variety of disease entities. The incremental, multiple point stimulation, spike-triggered averaging, F-wave, and statistical methods of MUNE are reviewed, along with data obtained using these methods in patients with neuropathy, motor neuron disorders, and muscle disease. All methods reviewed have theoretical concerns associated with them. However, with the exception of the spike-triggered averaging method, all give results in normal subjects that are quite similar. MUNE has been of great value in assessing progression of motor neuron disease, and has also shown promise in the assessment of generalized neuropathy. Despite the lack of a perfect method for performing MUNE, it has great clinical value in the assessment of progressive motor axon loss. Further refinements in the method will likely increase its utility in the future. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Synaptic Control of Motoneuronal Excitability. Physiol. Rev. 80: 767-852, 2000, -Movement, the fundamental component of behavior and the principal extrinsic action of the brain, is produced when skeletal muscles contract and relax in response to patterns of action potentials generated by motoneurons. The processes that determine the firing behavior of motoneurons are therefore important in understanding the transformation of neural activity to motor behavior. Here, we review recent studies on the control of motoneuronal excitability, focusing on synaptic and cellular properties. We first present a background description of motoneurons: their development, anatomical organization, and membrane properties, both passive and active. Pie then describe the general anatomical organization of synaptic input to motoneurons, followed by a description of the major transmitter systems that affect motoneuronal excitability, including ligands, receptor distribution, pre- and postsynaptic actions, signal transduction, and functional role. Glutamate is the main excitatory, and GABA and glycine are the main inhibitory transmitters acting through ionotropic receptors. These amino acids signal the principal motor commands from peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal structures. Amines, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, and neuropeptides, as well as the glutamate and GABA acting at metabotropic receptors, modulate motoneuronal excitability through pre- and postsynaptic actions. Acting principally via second messenger systems, their actions converge on commoneffecters, e.g., leak K+ current, cationic inward current, hyperpolarization-activated inward current, Ca2+ channels, or presynaptic release processes. Together, these numerous inputs mediate and modify incoming motor commands, ultimately generating the coordinated firing patterns that underlie muscle contractions during motor behavior.},

abstract = {Abductor hallucis is the largest muscle in the arch of the human foot and comprises few motor units relative to its physiological cross-sectional area. It has been described as a postural muscle, aiding in the stabilization of the longitudinal arch during stance and gait. The purpose of this study was to describe the discharge properties of abductor hallucis motor units during ramp and hold isometric contractions, as well as its discharge characteristics during fatigue. Intramuscular electromyographic recordings from abductor hallucis were made in 5 subjects; from those recordings, 42 single motor units were decomposed. Data were recorded during isometric ramp contractions at 60{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), performed before and after a submaximal isometric contraction to failure (mean force 41.3 ± 15.3{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC, mean duration 233 ± 116 s). Motor unit recruitment thresholds ranged from 10.3 to 54.2{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC. No significant difference was observed between recruitment and derecruitment thresholds or their respective discharge rates for both the initial and postfatigue ramp contractions (all P > 0.25). Recruitment threshold was positively correlated with recruitment discharge rate (r = 0.47, P < 0.03). All motor units attained similar peak discharge rates (14.0 ± 0.25 pulses/s) and were not correlated with recruitment threshold. Thirteen motor units could be followed during the isometric fatigue task, with a decline in discharge rate and increase in discharge rate variability occurring in the final 25{\{}{\%}{\}} of the task (both P < 0.05). We have shown that abductor hallucis motor units discharge relatively slowly and are considerably resistant to fatigue. These characteristics may be effective for generating and sustaining the substantial level of force that is required to stabilize the longitudinal arch during weight bearing.},

abstract = {Tremor in essential tremor (ET) is generated by pathological oscillations at 4-12 Hz, likely originating at cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways. However, the way in which tremor is represented in the output of the spinal cord circuitries is largely unknown because of the difficulties in identifying the behavior of individual motor units from tremulous muscles. By using novel methods for the decomposition of multichannel surface EMG, we provide a systematic analysis of the discharge properties of motor units in nine ET patients, with concurrent recordings of EEG activity. This analysis allowed us to infer the contribution of common synaptic inputs to motor neurons in ET. Motor unit short-term synchronization was significantly greater in ET patients than in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the strong association between the degree of synchronization and the peak in coherence between motor unit spike trains at the tremor frequency indicated that the high synchronization levels were generated mainly by common synaptic inputs specifically at the tremor frequency. The coherence between EEG and motor unit spike trains demonstrated the presence of common cortical input to the motor neurons at the tremor frequency. Nonetheless, the strength of this input was uncorrelated to the net common synaptic input at the tremor frequency, suggesting a contribution of spinal afferents or secondary supraspinal pathways in projecting common input at the tremor frequency. These results provide the first systematic analysis of the neural drive to the muscle in ET and elucidate some of its characteristics that determine pathological tremulous muscle activity.},

abstract = {In previous work we developed and validated a mathematical model that predicted force output from skeletal muscles subjected to six-pulse stimulation trains under isometric condition. The current study investigated the model's ability to predict force responses to longer stimulation trains under both nonfatigued and fatigued conditions. Using the six-pulse train model to predict the force produced by longer stimulation trains showed that the model was successful, but a modified parameter identification scheme was required. For most of the trains tested the model accounted for 95{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variance in the experimental forces produced by stimulation trains, with mean frequencies from 12.5 to 100 Hz, train durations from 485 to 1000 ms, and number of pulses from 14 to 50 for both nonfatigued and fatigued muscles. The success of our mathematical model in predicting forces produced by stimulations with a wide range of frequencies, durations, and number of pulses implies great potential of the model for the identification of optimal activation patterns that should be used during functional electrical stimulation.

The study aims at correlating EMG findings (single-fiber EMG and concentric-needle EMG) with various induced morphological changes. Methods: Reinnervation has been simulated by removing motor units randomly followed by a complete reinnervation from adjacent surviving motor units. Fibre type grouping and grouped atrophy can be seen. Myopathy is simulated by increased fibre diameter variation, loss of fibres and muscle fibre splitting. Results and conclusion: The simulation gives quantitative aspects of the importance of each of these factors. It indicates the relative sensitivity of various EMG parameters.

Cortical stimulation induced a short latency inhibition of H reflexes evoked in soleus motoneurones both at rest and during small voluntary contractions of soleus. 3. Spatial interaction between cortical inhibition of soleus motoneurons and inhibition evoked through identified spinal reflex machinery was investigated. 4. Interactions were found between cortically evoked inhibition and spinal Ia reciprocal inhibition, group I non-reciprocal inhibition and higher threshold components of longer latency reciprocal inhibition (D1 and D2 inhibitions). 5. Interactions were facilitatory when cortical and spinal inhibitory actions were weak and reversed to occlusion when both actions were strong. 6. It is concluded that the corticospinal pathway converges on the interneurones which subserve Ia reciprocal, group I non-reciprocal, D1 and D2 inhibition of soleus motoneurones. 7. No significant interaction was found under the present experimental conditions between cortical stimulation and group Ia-Ia presynaptic inhibition of soleus afferents. 8.

abstract = {This study was designed to assess the reliability of the first volitional (V) wave, which can be used as a measure of efferent neural drive, while also reflecting reflex excitability. Ten subjects volunteered for one familiarization session followed by an experimental test session and an identical retest session spaced 3 to 8 days apart. V-waves were evoked in the tibial nerve during plantar flexion maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVCs). Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), along with standard error of measurement and 95{\%} confidence intervals for the following variables: MVC force, surface electromyogram activity (EMG), and the peak-to-peak V-wave amplitude in soleus (SOL) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM). The superimposed M-wave (MSUP) accompanying V-wave stimulation was also obtained for normalization purposes. Substantial reliability was documented for V/MSUP in both SOL (ICC = 0.86) and GM (0.90), as well as for the non-normalized V-wave in SOL (0.92). Moderate reliability was displayed for the non-normalized V-wave response in GM (0.78). Substantial reliability was also established for EMG/MSUP (>0.82) and MVC force (0.98). This study provides novel evidence that V-wave responses can be consistently measured in the SOL and GM, thus advocating its continued use in future research.},

Young (n=10; mean: 22+/-1 years), old (n=10; mean: 67+/-2 years), and older-old (n=10; mean: 82+/-5 years) adult humans produced isometric second finger abduction force in both constant and sine-wave tasks at 5, 10, 20, and 40{\%} of their maximal voluntary contraction. Force and fine-wire intramuscular electromyography were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The amount and time-dependent structure of the discharge rate variability of single motor units and Fourier analysis of the rectified intramuscular EMG was performed. Force output variability increased across the young, old, and older-old groups. The amount and time-dependent structure of the discharge rate variability of single motor units did not differ between the young and aging groups. There was a progressive decrease in the relative power of approximately 40 Hz EMG activity from the young>old>older-old subjects across the 5, 10, 20, and 40{\%} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force levels. There was also a progressive increase in the relative power of the approximately 10 Hz EMG activity from young<old<older-old subjects at each target force level. The findings showed that a shift in the relative contribution of approximately 40 Hz to approximately 10 Hz neural activity is related to the reduced capacity of older adults to maintain optimal force control.},

Subjects held an object using a two-digit precision grip at a constant force at a flexed, neutral, and extended wrist posture, while the EMG activity from intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles was recorded through intramuscular fine-wire electrodes. The integral of z-transformed coherence computed across muscles pairs was greatest in the flexed wrist posture and significantly greater than EMG-EMG coherence measured in the neutral and extended wrist posture (.

Furthermore, EMG-EMG coherence did not differ statistically between the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle pairs, even though it tended to be greater for the extrinsic muscle pair (. P???. 0.063).

abstract = {Does the afterhyperpolarization current control the gain and discharge variability of motoneurones according to the same law? We investigated this issue in lumbar motoneurones of anaesthetized cats. Using dynamic clamp, we measured the conductance, time constant and driving force of the AHP current in a sample of motoneurones and studied how the gain was correlated to these quantities. To study the action of the AHP on the discharge variability and to compare it to its action on the gain, we injected an artificial AHP-like current in motoneurones. This increased the natural AHR In three motoneurones, we abolished most of the natural AHP with the calcium chelator BAPTA to investigate the condition where the discharge was essentially controlled by the artificial AHP. Our results demonstrate that both the gain and the coefficient of variation of the firing rate are inversely proportional to the magnitude and to the time constant of the artificial AHP conductance. This indicates that the AHP exerts the same control over the gain and the variability. This mechanism ensures that the variability of the discharge is modulated with the gain. This guarantees a great regularity of the discharge when the motoneurone is in a low excitability state and hence good control of the force produced.},

abstract = {In contrast to the limited response properties observed under normal experimental conditions, spinal motoneurons generate complex firing patterns, such as Ca2+-dependent regenerative spiking and plateaus, in the presence of certain neurotransmitters and ion-channel blockers. We have developed a quantitative motoneuron model, based on turtle motoneuron data, to investigate the roles of specific ionic currents and the effects of their soma and dendritic distribution in generating these complex firing patterns. In addition, the model is used to explore the effects of multiple ion channel blockers and neurotransmitters that are known to modulate motoneuron firing patterns. To represent the distribution of ionic currents across the soma and dendrites, the model contains two compartments. The soma compartment, representing the soma and proximal dendrites, contains Hodgkin-Huxley-like sodium (I-Na) and delayed rectifier K+ (IK-dr) currents, an N-like Ca2+ current (ICn-N), and a calcium-dependent K+ current [I-K(Ca)]. The dendritic compartment, representing the lumped distal dendrites, contains, in addition to ICa-N and I-K(Ca) as in the soma, a persistent L-Iike calcium current (ICa-L) We determined kinetic parameters for I-Na, IK-dr, ICa-N, and I-K(Ca) in order to reproduce normal action-potential firing observed in turtle spinal motoneurons, including fast and slow afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) and a linear steady-state frequency-current relation. With this parameter set as default, a sequence of pharmacological manipulations were systematically simulated. A small reduction of IK-dr [mimicking the experimental effect of tetraethylammonium (TEA) in low concentration] enhanced the slow AHP and caused calcium spiking (mediated by ICa-N) when I-Na was blocked. Firing patterns observed experimentally in high TEA [and tetrodotoxin (TTX)], namely calcium spikes riding on a calcium plateau, were reproduced only when both IK-dr and I-K(Ca), were reduced. Dendritic plateau potentials, mediated by ICa-L, were reliably unmasked when I-K(Ca) was reduced, mimicking the experimental effect of the bee venom apamin. The effect of 5-HT, which experimentally induces the ability to generate calcium-dependent plateau potentials but not calcium spiking, was reproduced in the model by reducing IK(Cn) alone. The plateau threshold current level, however, was reduced substantially if a simultaneous increase in ICa-L was simulated, suggesting that serotonin (5-HT) induces plateau potentials by regulating more than one conductance. The onset of the plateau potential showed significant delays in response to near-threshold, depolarizing current steps. In addition, the delay times were sensitive to the current step amplitude. The delay and its sensitivity were explained by examining the model's behavior near the threshold for plateau onset. This modeling study thus accurately accounts for the basic firing behavior of vertebrate motoneurons as well as a range of complex firing patterns invoked by ion-channel blockers and 5-HT. In addition, our computational results support the hypothesis that the electroresponsiveness of motoneurons depends on a nonuniform distribution of ionic conductances, and they predict modulatory effects of 5-HT and properties of plateau activation that have yet to be tested experimentally.},

abstract = {We studied the extent to which automatic postural actions in standing human subjects are organized by a limited repertoire of central motor programs. Subjects stood on support surfaces of various lengths, which forced them to adopt different postural movement strategies to compensate for the same external perturbations. We assessed whether a continuum or a limited set of muscle activation patterns was used to produce different movement patterns and the extent to which movement patterns were influenced by prior experience. Exposing subjects standing on a normal support surface to brief forward and backward horizontal surface perturbations elicited relatively stereotyped patterns of leg and trunk muscle activation with 73- to 110-ms latencies. Activity began in the ankle joint muscles and then radiated in sequence to thigh and then trunk muscles on the same dorsal or ventral aspect of the body. This activation pattern exerted compensatory torques about the ankle joints, which restored equilibrium by moving the body center of mass forward or backward. This pattern has been termed the ankle strategy because it restores equilibrium by moving the body primarily around the ankle joints. To successfully maintain balance while standing on a support surface short in relation to foot length, subjects activated leg and trunk muscles at similar latencies but organized the activity differently. The trunk and thigh muscles antagonistic to those used in the ankle strategy were activated in the opposite proximal-to-distal sequence, whereas the ankle muscles were generally unresponsive. This activation pattern produced a compensatory horizontal shear force against the support surface but little, if any, ankle torque. This pattern has been termed the hip strategy, because the resulting motion is focused primarily about the hip joints. Exposing subjects to horizontal surface perturbations while standing on support surfaces intermediate in length between the shortest and longest elicited more complex postural movements and associated muscle activation patterns that resembled ankle and hip strategies combined in different temporal relations. These complex postural movements were executed with combinations of torque and horizontal shear forces and motions of ankle and hip joints. During the first 5-20 practice trials immediately following changes from one support surface length to another, response latencies were unchanged. The activation patterns, however, were complex and resembled the patterns observed during well-practiced stance on surfaces of intermediate lengths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the transcortical nature of the long-latency stretch reflex (M3) in the human tibialis anterior muscle. This was achieved by applying a single pulse of subthreshold (90{\%} motor threshold) transcortical magnetic stimulation (subTMS) at the site of the motor cortex. Such a stimulus is able to activate intracortical inhibitory circuits and thereby depress motor cortical output. We hypothesized that it would also suppress a transcortical reflex loop. The stretch reflex was elicited using a pedal attached to an electric motor. SubTMS was applied at several intervals prior to M3. Recordings were repeated 20-40 times. The reflex components were quantified using 20-ms windows in the averaged rectified electromyogram (EMG). SubTMS evoked significantly larger depression of M3 than of the background EMG in the same time frame when applied 55-85 ms prior to M3 ( P<0.05, n=10). Furthermore, the effect on M3 was significantly larger than the effect on the spinal M2 ( P<0.01, n=7). Our results provide evidence that the long-latency stretch reflex in the tibialis anterior muscle is at least partly transcortical.},

abstract = {We electrophysiologically examined the transition from physiologic tremor to essential tremor in people at risk for familial essential tremor. Two healthy people from different families with hereditary essential tremor were studied on multiple occasions. A 23-year-old man was studied in 1995, 1997, and 2004, and a 44-year-old woman was studied in 1993, 1995, 1997, and 2003. Hand acceleration and forearm electromyographic readings were measured with and without 300-g loading to determine the characteristic frequency-invariant motor unit entrainment of essential tremor. Clinically and electrophysiologically, the man and woman had normal tremor until the last examination, when both exhibited a fine tremulousness in the outstretched hands and frequency-invariant motor unit entrainment at 7.5 and 6.5 Hz, respectively. At no time did either patient exhibit a prominent 8-12 Hz component of physiologic tremor. Essential tremor in young adults may begin at frequencies less than 8-12 Hz, and this electrophysiologic abnormality is detectable when clinical examinations reveal only questionably abnormal tremor. More young adults at risk for essential tremor must be studied to determine whether initial frequencies less than 8 Hz are the rule or the exception. Nevertheless, the data from our 2 patients demonstrate that a prominent 8-12 Hz component of physiologic tremor does not always precede the development of essential tremor; therefore, the origins of essential tremor and the 8-12 Hz component of physiologic tremor may be different.},

abstract = {We have previously demonstrated an increase in the excitability of the leg motor cortical area in relation to acquisition of a visuo-motor task in healthy humans. It remains unknown whether the interaction between corticospinal drive and spinal motoneurones is also modulated following motor skill learning. Here we investigated the effect of visuo-motor skill training involving the ankle muscles on the coupling between electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded from the motor cortex (Cz) and electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the left tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in 11 volunteers. Coupling in the time (cumulant density function) and frequency domains (coherence) between EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG activity were calculated during tonic isometric dorsiflexion before and after 32 min of training a visuo-motor tracking task involving the ankle muscles or performing alternating dorsi- and plantarflexion movements without visual feedback. A significant increase in EEG-EMG coherence around 15-35 Hz was observed following the visuo-motor skill session in nine subjects and in only one subject after the control task. Changes in coherence were specific to the trained muscle as coherence for the untrained contralateral TA muscle was unchanged. EEG and EMG power were unchanged following the training. Our results suggest that visuo-motor skill training is associated with changes in the corticospinal drive to spinal motorneurones. Possibly these changes reflect sensorimotor integration processes between cortex and muscle as part of the motor learning process.},

abstract = {Aging has been associated with a loss of muscle mass that is referred to as `sarcopenia'. This decrease in muscle tissue begins around the age of 50 years, but becomes more dramatic beyond the 60th year of life. Loss of muscle mass among the aged directly results in diminished muscle function. Decreased strength and power contribute to the high incidence of accidental falls observed among the elderly and can compromise quality of life. Moreover, sarcopenia has been linked to several chronic afflictions that are common among the aged, including osteoporosis, insulin resistance and arthritis. Loss of muscle fibre number is the principal cause of sarcopenia, although fibre atrophy - particularly among type II fibres - is also involved. Several physiological mechanisms have been implicated in the development of sarcopenia. Denervation results in the loss of motor units and thus, muscle fibres. A decrease in the production of anabolic hormones such as testosterone, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 impairs the capacity of skeletal muscle to incorporate amino acids and synthesise proteins. An increase in the release of catabolic agents, specifically interleukin-6, amplifies the rate of muscle wasting among the elderly. Given the demographic trends evident in most western societies, i.e. increased number of those considered aged, management interventions for sarcopenia must become a major goal of the healthcare profession.},

@article{Poliakov1997,
abstract = {1. We studied the responses of rat hypoglossal and cat lumbar motoneurones to a variety of excitatory and inhibitory injected current transients during repetitive discharge. The amplitudes and time courses of the transients were comparable to those of the synaptic currents underlying unitary and small compound postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) recorded in these cells. Poisson trains of ten of these excitatory and ten inhibitory current transients were combined with an additional independent, high-frequency random waveform to approximate band limited white noise. The white noise waveform was then superimposed on long duration (39 a) suprathreshold current steps. 2. We measured the effects of each of the current transients on motoneurone discharge by compiling peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) between the times of occurrence of individual current transients and motoneurone discharges. We estimated the changes in membrane potential associated with each current transient by approximating the passive response of the motoneurone with a simple resistance-capacitance circuit. The relations between the features of these simulated PSPs and those of the PSTHs were similar to those reported previously for red PSPs: the short-latency PSTH peak (or trough) was generally longer than the initial phase of the PSP derivative, but shorter than the time course of the PSP itself. Linear models of the PSP to PSTH transform based on the PSP time course, the time derivative of the PSP, or a linear combination of the two parameters could not reproduce the full range of PSTH profiles observed. 3. We also used the responses of the motoneurones to the white noise stimulus to derive zero-, first-and second-order Wiener kernels, which provide a quantitative description of the relation between injected current and discharge probability. The convolution integral computed for an injected current waveform and the first-order Wiener kernel should provide the best linear prediction of the associated PSTH. This linear model provided good matches to the PSTHs associated with a wide range of current transients. However, for the largest amplitude current transients, a significant improvement in the PSTH match was often achieved by expanding the model to include the convolution of the second-order Wiener kernel with the input. 4. The overall transformation of current inputs into firing rate could be approximated by a second-order Wiener model, i.e. a cascade of a dynamic, linear filter follow ed by a static nonlinearity. At a given mean firing rate, the non-linear component of the response of the motoneurone could be described by the square of the linear component multiplied by a constant coefficient. The amplitude of the response of the linear component increased with the average firing rate, whereas the value of the multiplicative coefficient in the non-linear component decreased. As a result, the overall transform could be predicted from the mean firing rate and the linear impulse response, yielding a relatively simple, general description of the motoneurone input-output function.},

abstract = {The integrate-and-fire neuron model is one of the most widely used models for analyzing the behavior of neural systems. It describes the membrane potential of a neuron in terms of the synaptic inputs and the injected current that it receives. An action potential (spike) is generated when the membrane potential reaches a threshold, but the actual changes associated with the membrane voltage and conductances driving the action potential do not form part of the model. The synaptic inputs to the neuron are considered to be stochastic and are described as a temporally homogeneous Poisson process. Methods and results for both current synapses and conductance synapses are examined in the diffusion approximation, where the individual contributions to the postsynaptic potential are small. The focus of this review is upon the mathematical techniques that give the time distribution of output spikes, namely stochastic differential equations and the Fokker-Planck equation. The integrate-and-fire neuron model has become established as a canonical model for the description of spiking neurons because it is capable of being analyzed mathematically while at the same time being sufficiently complex to capture many of the essential features of neural processing. A number of variations of the model are discussed, together with the relationship with the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model and the comparison with electrophysiological data. A brief overview is given of two issues in neural information processing that the integrate-and-fire neuron model has contributed to - the irregular nature of spiking in cortical neurons and neural gain modulation.},

abstract = {1. The main purpose of this study was to collate population data on the firing characteristics of muscle afferents recorded chronically during normal stepping in cats. 2. Ensemble firing profiles of forty-seven muscle spindle and tendon organ afferents were compiled from stored data. The relationships between the firing profiles and the displacement and force signals were analysed with the help of mathematical models of the response characteristics of spindle primary and secondary afferents and tendon organs. 3. Whereas the firing of hamstring spindle afferents could be predicted with reasonable accuracy from the length and velocity signals alone, the firing profiles of triceps surae spindle afferents deviated from the predicted profiles, particularly during electromyogram (EMG) activity. This indicated that the components of fusimotor action linked to extrafusal muscle activity were significant in triceps surae, possibly because this muscle is more strongly recruited in the cat step cycle. 4. From the limited data available, it was not possible to identify the 'best' or most general mathematical function to predict spindle secondary firing. In the two triceps surae spindle secondary units studied, firing was well predicted by using the simplest possible model, rate proportional to displacement, whereas in the hamstring spindle secondary data, a more complex linear transfer function was needed. The results of modelling the spindle secondary data were consistent with a modest amount of phasic, static fusimotor action linked to EMG activity. 5. The averaged ensemble of tendon organ afferent activity from the triceps surae gave predictions of whole-muscle force that agreed well with separate triceps force measurements in normal cat locomotion. This supports the idea that ensembles of tendon organ afferents signal whole-muscle force. 6. Our overall conclusion is that to a first approximation, large muscle afferents in the cat hindlimb signal muscle velocity, muscle length and muscle force, at least in movements of the speed and amplitude seen in locomotion.},

abstract = {Background: Electromyography (EMG) is the study of muscle function through the inquiry of electrical signals that the muscles emanate. EMG signals collected from the surface of the skin ( Surface Electromyogram: sEMG) can be used in different applications such as recognizing musculoskeletal neural based patterns intercepted for hand prosthesis movements. Current systems designed for controlling the prosthetic hands either have limited functions or can only be used to perform simple movements or use excessive amount of electrodes in order to achieve acceptable results. In an attempt to overcome these problems we have proposed an intelligent system to recognize hand movements and have provided a user assessment routine to evaluate the correctness of executed movements. Methods: We propose to use an intelligent approach based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) integrated with a real-time learning scheme to identify hand motion commands. For this purpose and to consider the effect of user evaluation on recognizing hand movements, vision feedback is applied to increase the capability of our system. By using this scheme the user may assess the correctness of the performed hand movement. In this work a hybrid method for training fuzzy system, consisting of back-propagation ( BP) and least mean square (LMS) is utilized. Also in order to optimize the number of fuzzy rules, a subtractive clustering algorithm has been developed. To design an effective system, we consider a conventional scheme of EMG pattern recognition system. To design this system we propose to use two different sets of EMG features, namely time domain (TD) and time-frequency representation (TFR). Also in order to decrease the undesirable effects of the dimension of these feature sets, principle component analysis (PCA) is utilized. Results: In this study, the myoelectric signals considered for classification consists of six unique hand movements. Features chosen for EMG signal are time and time-frequency domain. In this work we demonstrate the capability of an EMG pattern recognition system using ANFIS as classifier with a real-time learning method. Our results reveal that the utilized real-time ANFIS approach along with the user evaluation provides a 96.7{\%} average accuracy. This rate is superior to the previously reported result utilizing artificial neural networks ( ANN) real-time method [ 1]. Conclusion: This study shows that ANFIS real-time learning method coupled with mixed time and time-frequency features as EMG features can provide acceptable results for designing sEMG pattern recognition system suitable for hand prosthesis control.},

abstract = {Axonal conduction velocity and its relations to different contractile properties of motor units of medial gastrocnemius muscle were investigated in nine Wistar rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone. Functionally isolated motor units were identified as slow (S), fast resistant (FR) and fast fatigable (FF). Axons of S motor units conducted significantly more slowly than of fast units, while there was considerable overlap between conduction velocities measured for FR and FF types. The mean values of conduction velocity were 50.9 m/s for S, 68.9 m/s for FR and 71.3 m/s for FF type motor units. Strong and significant negative correlation between conduction velocity and contraction time as well as half-relaxation time was demonstrated. However, only a weak correlation between conduction velocity and twitch tension, tetanic tension or fatigue index was found. The multiple regression analysis revealed that the major factor to determine conduction velocity was contraction time.},

abstract = {The influence of the muscle length on the propagation velocity of the extraterritorial action potentials was studied. Single low--threshold motor units (MUs) from m. biceps brachii, both with superficially and deeply situated fibers were investigated. The velocity of excitation propagation decreases with the muscle elongation. This dependence is not so prominent for MUs having more deeply situated fibers. In case of superficial MUs the experimentally obtained values are in better agreement with the core conductor model (v = k.square root of r), than with the linear dependence of the propagation velocity (v) on the muscle fiber radius (r) (v = k.r) observed by Hakansson (1957) on frog muscles. The observed difference between superficial and deep MUs was discussed. At least two factors may be responsible for greater changes of the excitation propagation velocity along the fibers of the superficially situated MUs during the muscle elongation. One possible factor is the essential change in the external resistance due to the decrease of distance from the fibers to the skin surface. The greater change of the muscle length during a passive muscle stretching might be another reason.},

abstract = {Blockade of neuromuscular activity during the period of naturally occurring cell death increases intramuscular nerve branching, synaptogenesis, and survival of embryonic chicken motoneurons. These results suggested that the enhanced motoneuron survival observed might result not from increased production of a trophic factor by the target, as often suggested, but rather from the enhanced ability of motoneurons to take up this factor via additional branches and/ or synapses. Since removal of polysialic acid (PSA) by PSA-specific endoneuraminidase (endo N) during the period of nerve ingrowth and motoneuron cell death had been shown to reduce intramuscular nerve branching by altering adhesive interactions between axons and myotubes, we wished to determine, first, if this resulted in a reduction of synapse formation, and second, if this was correlated with decreased motoneuron survival. When PSA was removed from embryonic day 6 (E6) to Eg by injecting endo N into the limb, the number of synapses in the posterior iliotibialis muscle was greatly reduced both at E6.5, the onset of the cell death period, and at E7.5-E8, the middle of the cell death period. Total motoneuron counts at both E7.5-E8 and E10 (close to the end of cell death period) were significantly decreased compared to controls. These results indicate that a treatment that reduces intramuscular nerve branching and synapse formation also affects motoneuron survival. Furthermore, since removal of PSA in ovo via endo N altered neither the spontaneous embryonic motility nor the activation pattern of motoneurons or muscles, these experiments avoid the complication of activity blockade that may alter motoneuron survival by affecting events other than, or in addition to, intramuscular nerve branching.},

abstract = {When we learn a new motor skill, such as playing an approaching tennis ball, both our sensors and the task possess variability. Our sensors provide imperfect information about the ball's velocity, so we can only estimate it. Combining information from multiple modalities can reduce the error in this estimate. On a longer time scale, not all velocities are a priori equally probable, and over the course of a match there will be a probability distribution of velocities. According to bayesian theory, an optimal estimate results from combining information about the distribution of velocities-the prior-with evidence from sensory feedback. As uncertainty increases, when playing in fog or at dusk, the system should increasingly rely on prior knowledge. To use a bayesian strategy, the brain would need to represent the prior distribution and the level of uncertainty in the sensory feedback. Here we control the statistical variations of a new sensorimotor task and manipulate the uncertainty of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the statistical distribution of the task and their sensory uncertainty, combining them in a manner consistent with a performance-optimizing bayesian process. The central nervous system therefore employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning.},

abstract = {Reflex responses to mechanical stimulation of muscle (brief imposed movement) were investigated. Reflexes were elicited in the forefinger, recording from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI), and in the foot, recording from soleus. These responses typically consisted of a short-latency component (M1) and a long-latency component (M2) at 33 ms and 53 ms, respectively, after the stimulus in the case of FDI, and 37 ms and 68 ms, respectively, in soleus upon stimulation of the sole of the foot. Normally, when a muscle is stretched by a mechanical stimulus (either naturally or by an experimentally imposed movement), both skin receptors and muscle stretch receptors are activated. It is possible, however, to devise stimulation parameters where this is not the case. Fixating the finger with plasticine enables the effects of skin stimulation to be studied without stretching the FDI muscle. On the other hand, tapping a long tendon allows muscle stretch receptors to be activated without involving skin or subcutaneous structures. Component M1 was always abolished by finger fixation in 40 trials on 10 subjects, with M2 being essentially unchanged in latency, duration, or amplitude. Reflex responses were obtained in soleus muscle in nine experiments by prodding the sole of the foot (thereby stimulating both skin and muscle stretch receptors). Alternatively, the tendo achilles was prodded (which solely activates stretch receptors in the muscle). In the former, M1 and M2 were generated. In the latter, only M1 was produced. It is concluded that the long-latency component of the stretch reflex, M2, originates in skin and/or subcutaneous nerve terminals and that no part of M2 originates in muscle stretch receptors.},

abstract = {1. Presynaptic inhibition of soleus muscle Ia afferent fibres, produced by stimulation of group I afferents in the common peroneal nerve, was assessed from changes in the H reflex at long conditioning intervals, in six normal subjects. 2. Stimulation of the ipsilateral sural nerve at the malleolus, just before stimulation of the common peroneal nerve at the head of the fibula, decreased the presynaptic inhibition. This effect was strongest during voluntary plantar flexion and weaker during dorsiflexion or at rest. 3. Stimulation of other cutaneous nerve branches serving the dorsum of the ipsilateral foot, and also the contralateral sural nerve, decreased presynaptic inhibition. Adequate stimulation of low threshold cutaneous mechanoreceptors by light brushing of both distal dorsal and plantar surfaces of the ipsilateral foot decreased presynaptic inhibition. 4. Stimulation of the ipsilateral plantar nerves increased presynaptic inhibition, but this action is attributed to activation of group I afferents from the intrinsic muscles of the foot. 5. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the lower limb area of the contralateral motor cortex decreased presynaptic inhibition. This effect was strongest during voluntary plantar flexion and weaker during dorsiflexion or at rest. 6. The actions of cutaneous and corticospinal pathways completely occluded each other. However, when both effects were adjusted to be liminal, a spatial facilitation between them was observed. 7. It is concluded that in man, as in the cat, cutaneous and corticospinal axons converge on interneurones that inhibit the machinery of presynaptic inhibition of group Ia afferents. These actions may be responsible for the modulation of presynaptic inhibition which has been observed to precede and accompany a wide range of human movements.},

abstract = {Each of the descending pathways involved in motor control has a number of anatomical, molecular, pharmacological, and neuroinformatic characteristics. They are differentially involved in motor control, a process that results from operations involving the entire motor network rather than from the brain commanding the spinal cord. A given pathway can have many functional roles. This review explores to what extent descending pathways are highly conserved across species and concludes that there are actually rather widespread species differences, for example, in the transmission of information from the corticospinal tract to upper limb motoneurons. The significance of direct, corticomotoneuronal (CM) connections, which were discovered a little more than 50 years ago, is reassessed. I conclude that although these connections operate in parallel with other less direct linkages to motoneurons, CM influence is significant and may subserve some special functions including adaptive motor behaviors involving the distal extremities.},

Six healthy subjects (three men and three women) were recruited to conduct the force-tracking tasks comprising two finger patterns, i.e., natural combination of index and middle fingers and unnatural combination of index and middle fingers (i.e., simultaneously producing equal force strength in index and middle finger). During the conducting of the tasks with right index and middle finger, MEG and sEMG signals were recorded from left primary motor cortex (M1) and right flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), respectively; the contralateral CMC was calculated to assess the neuromuscular interaction. Finger force-tracking tasks of Common-IM only induce beta-band CMC, whereas Uncommon-IM tasks produce CMC in both beta and low-gamma band. Compared to the force-tracking tasks of Common-IM, the Uncommon-IM task is associated with the most intensive contralateral CMC. Our study demonstrated that the pattern of finger coordination had significant impact on the CMC between the contralateral M1 and hand muscles, and more corticomuscular interaction was necessary for unnaturally coordinated finger activities to regulate the fixed neural drive of hand muscles.},

abstract = {Nonstationary signals with finite time support are frequently encountered in electrophysiology and other fields of biomedical research. It is often desirable to have a compact description of their shape and of their time evolution. For this purpose, Fourier analysis is not necessarily the best tool. The Hermite-Rodriguez and Associated Hermite basis functions are applied in this work. Both are based on the product of Hermite polynomials and Gaussian functions. Their general properties relevant to biomedical signal processing are reviewed. Preliminary applications are described concerning the analysis and description of: a) test signals such as a square pulse and a single cycle of a sinewave, b) electrically evoked myoelectric signals, and c) power spectra of either voluntary or evoked signals. It is shown that expansions with only five to ten terms provide an excellent description of the computer simulated and real signals. It is shown that these two families of Hermite functions are well suited for the analysis of nonstationary biological evoked potentials with compact time support. An application to the estimation of scaling factors of electrically evoked myoelectric signals is described. The Hermite functions show advantages with respect to the more traditional spectral analysis, especially in the case of signal truncation due to stimulation with interpulse intervals smaller than the duration of the evoked response. Finally, the Hermite approach is found to be suitable for classification of spectral shapes and compression of spectral information of either voluntary or evoked signals. The approach is very promising for neuromuscular diagnosis and assessment because of its capability for information compression and waveform classification.},

abstract = {The firing pattern of low-threshold motor units was examined in the human trapezius and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles during slowly augmenting, low-amplitude contractions that were intended to mimic contractile activity in postural muscles. The motor unit activity was detected with a special needle electrode and was analyzed with the assistance of computer algorithms. The surface electromyographic (EMG) signal was recorded. Its root-mean-square (RMS) value was calculated and presented to the subject who used it to regulate the muscle force level. In the trapezius, there was minimal, if any, firing rate modulation of early recruited motor units during slow contractions (less than or equal to1{\%} EMG(max)/s), and later recruited motor units consistently presented higher peak firing rates. As the force rate of the contraction increased (3{\%} EMG(max)/s), the firing rates of the motor units in the trapezius approached an orderly hierarchical pattern with the earliest recruited motor units having the greatest firing rate. In contrast, and as reported previously, the firing rates of all motor units in the FDI always presented the previously reported hierarchical "onion-skin" pattern. We conclude that the low-threshold motor units in the postural trapezius muscle, that is the motor units that are most often called on to activate the muscle in postural activities, have different control features in slow and fast contractions. More detailed analysis revealed that, in the low force-rate contractions of the trapezius, recruitment of new motor units inhibited the firing rate of active motor units, providing an explanation for the depressed firing rate of the low-threshold motor units. We speculate that Renshaw cell inhibition contributes to the observed deviation of the low-threshold motor units from the hierarchical onion-skin pattern.},

abstract = {Evaluation of postural control is generally based on the interpretation of the center of pressure (COP) and the center of mass (COM) time series. The purpose of this study is to compare three methods to estimate the COM which are based on different biomechanical considerations. These methods are: (1) the kinematic method; (2) the zero-point-to-zero-point double integration technique (GLP) and (3) the COP low-pass filter method (LPF). The COP and COM time series have been determined using an experimental setup with a force plate and a 3D kinematic system on six healthy young adult subjects during four different 30s standing tasks: (a) quiet standing; (b) one leg standing; (c) voluntary oscillation about the ankles and (d) voluntary oscillation about the ankles and hips. To test the difference between the COM trajectories, the root mean square (RMS) differences between each method (three comparisons) were calculated. The RMS differences between kinematic-LPF and GLP-LPF are significantly larger than kinematic-GLP. Our results show that the GLP method is comparable to the kinematic method. Both agree with the unified theory of balance during upright stance. The GLP method is attractive in the clinical perspective because it requires only a force plate to determine the COP-COM variable, which has been demonstrated to have a high reliability. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from hindlimb motoneurons in decerebrate cats to study how synaptic inputs could affect the threshold at which plateau potentials are activated with current injections through the recording microelectrode in the cell body. This study was prompted by recent evidence that the noninactivating inward currents that regeneratively produce the plateau potentials arise (partly) from dendritic conductances, which may be relatively more accessible to synaptic input than to current injected into the soma. Initially, cells were studied by injecting a slow triangular current ramp intracellularly to determine the threshold for activation of the plateau. In cells where the sodium spikes were blocked with intracellular QX314, plateau activation was readily seen as a sudden jump in membrane potential, which was not directly reversed as the current was decreased. With normal spiking, the plateau activation (the noninactivating inward current) was reflected by a steep and sustained jump in firing rate that was not directly reversed as the current was decreased. Importantly, the threshold for plateau activation (at 34 Hz on average) was significantly above the recruitment level(13 Hz on average). When tonic synaptic excitation [excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)] was provided either by stretching the triceps surae muscle or by stimulating its nerve at a high frequency, the threshold for plateau activation by intracellular current injection was significantly lowered (by 12 Hz or 5.8 mV on average, without and with QX314, respectively). Conversely, tonic synaptic inhibition [inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)], provided by appropriate nerve stimulation, significantly raised the plateau threshold (by 19 Hz or 7.6 mV on average). These effects were graded with the intensity of tonic EPSPs and IPSPs. Strong enough EPSPs brought the plateau threshold down sufficiently that it was activated by the intracellular current soon after recruitment. A further increase in tonic EPSPs recruited the cell directly, and in this case the plateau was activated at or before recruitment. The finding that synaptic excitation can produce plateau activation below the recruitment level is of importance for the interpretation of its function. With this low-threshold activation, the plateau potentials are likely important in securing an effective recruitment to frequencies that produce significant force generation and would subsequently have no further affect on the frequency modulation, other than to provide a steady depolarizing bias that would help to sustain firing (cf. self-sustained firing). Additional jumps in frequency after recruitment (i.e., bistable firing) would not be expected.},

abstract = {Synaptic integration in vivo often involves activation of many afferent inputs whose firing patterns modulate over time. In spinal motoneurons, sustained excitatory inputs undergo enormous enhancement due to persistent inward currents (PICs) that are generated primarily in the dendrites and are dependent on monoaminergic neuromodulatory input from the brain stem to the spinal cord. We measured the interaction between dendritic PICs and inhibition generated by tonic electrical stimulation of nerves to antagonist muscles during voltage clamp in motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of the cat. Separate samples of cells were obtained for two different states of monoaminergic input: standard (provided by the decerebrate preparation, which has tonic activity in monoaminergic axons) and minimal (the chloralose anesthetized preparation, which lacks tonic monoaminergic input). In the standard state, steady inhibition that increased the input conductance of the motoneurons by an average of 38{\%} reduced the PIC by 69{\%}. The range of this reduction, from <10{\%} to >100{\%}, was proportional to the magnitude of the applied inhibition. Thus nearly linear integration of synaptic inhibition may occur in these highly active dendrites. In the minimal state, PICs were much smaller, being approximately equal to inhibition-suppressed PICs in the standard state. Inhibition did not further reduce these already small PICs. Overall, these results demonstrate that inhibition from local spinal circuits can oppose the facilitation of dendritic PICs by descending monoaminergic inputs. As a result, local inhibition may also suppress active dendritic integration of excitatory inputs.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in widespread variation in muscle function. Review of motor unit data shows that changes in the amount and balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs after SCI alter management of motoneurons. Not only are units recruited up to higher than usual relative forces when SCI leaves few units under voluntary control, the force contribution from recruitment increases due to elevation of twitch/tetanic force ratios. Force gradation and precision are also coarser with reduced unit numbers. Maximal unit firing rates are low in hand muscles, limiting voluntary strength, but are low, normal or high in limb muscles. Unit firing rates during spasms can exceed voluntary rates, emphasizing that deficits in descending drive limit force production. SCI also changes muscle properties. Motor unit weakness and fatigability seem universal across muscles and species, increasing the muscle weakness that arises from paralysis of units, motoneuron death and sensory impairment. Motor axon conduction velocity decreases after human SCI. Muscle contractile speed is also reduced, which lowers the stimulation frequencies needed to grade force when paralysed muscles are activated with patterned electrical stimulation. This slowing does not necessarily occur in hind limb muscles after cord transection in cats and rats. The nature, duration and level of SCI underlie some of these species differences, as do variations in muscle function, daily usage, tract control and fibre-type composition. Exploring this diversity is important to promote recovery of the hand, bowel, bladder and locomotor function most wanted by people with SCI.},

abstract = {A recent model of balance control has revealed two types of boundaries describing stability limits for center of mass (CM) dynamics: torque boundaries and state boundaries. The purpose of this study was to determine if these boundaries correctly characterize empirical data. We analyzed 2367 trials from 10 subjects who recovered their balance after they voluntarily pulled on a handle. We hypothesized that if model predictions were valid, both types of boundaries should encompass the empirical trajectories. We also hypothesized that each trajectory's nearest distance to the torque boundaries (the torque safety margin) would be correlated with the center of pressure (COP) safety margin, defined as the COP's nearest distance to the edge of the feet. The results supported the accuracy of the model-derived boundaries, with torque boundaries encompassing 100{\%} and state boundaries encompassing 99.8{\%} of the trials. Moreover, torque safety margins were highly correlated with COP safety margins, supporting the use of COP safety margins for estimating relative stability in dynamic tasks where balance is maintained. The distributions of the trajectories also suggested that a safety margin-oriented control strategy might be a robust alternative to the hypothesis that the central nervous system strives to optimize motion. The distinctions among different safety margins are discussed.},

abstract = {H-reflexes are progressively depressed, relative to the first response, at stimulation frequencies above 0.1 Hz (postactivation depression; PAD). Presently, we investigated whether H-reflexes "recover" from this depression throughout 10-s trains of stimulation delivered at physiologically relevant frequencies (5-20 Hz) during functionally relevant tasks (sitting and standing) and contraction amplitudes [relaxed to 20{\%} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)]. When participants held a 10{\%} MVC, reflex amplitudes did not change during 5-Hz stimulation. During stimulation at 10 Hz, reflexes were initially depressed by 43{\%} but recovered completely by the end of the stimulation period. During 20-Hz stimulation, reflexes were depressed to 10{\%} and recovered to 36{\%} of the first response, respectively. This "postactivation depression and recovery" (PAD{\&}R) of reflex amplitude was not different between sitting and standing. In contrast, PAD{\&}R were strongly influenced by contraction amplitude. Reflexes were depressed to 10{\%} of the first response during the relaxed condition (10-Hz stimulation) and showed no depression during a 20{\%} MVC contraction. A partial recovery of reflex amplitude occurred when participants were relaxed and during contractions of 1-5{\%} MVC. Surprisingly, reflexes could recover completely by the third pulse within a stimulation train when participants held a contraction between 5 and 10{\%} MVC during stimulation at 10 Hz, a finding that challenges classical ideas regarding PAD mechanisms. Our results support the idea that there is an ongoing interplay between depression and facilitation when motoneurons receive trains of afferent input. This interplay depends strongly on the frequency of the afferent input and the magnitude of the background contraction but is relatively insensitive to changes in task.},

The reflex loops include the spindle organ, Golgi tendon organ, and Renshaw cell. Their effects are investigated quantitatively in detail. A two-muscle (agonist/antagonist) system with interaction is further studied. Moreover, a model in combination with the central oscillation and peripheral system is developed.

Fourteen young healthy men performed a submaximal force-matching task of isometric plantar flexion before and after Achilles tendon vibration (n = 8, vibration subjects) or lying without vibration (n = 6, control subjects) for 30 min. The target forces were 2.5-10{\{}{\%}{\}} of the previbration maximal voluntary contraction force. The standard deviation of force decreased by a mean of 29 +/- 20{\{}{\%}{\}} across target forces after vibration, whereas it did not decrease significantly in control subjects (-5 +/- 12{\{}{\%}{\}}). This change was significantly greater compared with control subjects (P < 0.01 for both). Power spectral density of the force was predominantly composed of signals of low-frequency bandwidth ({\{}{\&}{\}}LE;5 Hz) with few higher frequency components. In vibration subjects, there was a significant decrease in power in the frequency range {\{}{\&}{\}}LE;2 Hz after vibration. The decrease in power at this frequency range was linearly related to the decrease in the force fluctuations (r = 0.96, P < 0.001). The results indicate that prolonged Achilles tendon vibration reduces the fluctuations in plantar flexion force in the frequency range less than or equal to2 Hz during low-level contractions. It suggests that Ia afferent inputs contribute to the low-frequency force fluctuations in plantar flexion.},

abstract = {This study aimed to apply an uncontrolled manifold (UCM) approach to investigate how children utilize the variability of multiple body segment movement to facilitate the center of mass (COM) control during quiet stance. Three groups of participants were included in this study: younger children (YC, mean age 6.3 years), older children (OC, mean age 10.3 years), and young adults (YA, mean age 20.5 years). Participants stood on a force platform with their hands on the iliac crests for 40 s in each trial. Two visual conditions were examined including eyes-open and eyes-closed and three trials were collected for each condition. Results showed that all three groups partitioned more variability of multi-segment movement into the UCM subspace (maintaining the mean COM position) than into the ORT subspace (a subspace orthogonal to the UCM subspace, causing the deviation of the COM from its mean position) in both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Furthermore, both the YC and OC groups partitioned a significantly higher percentage of variability into the UCM subspace than the YA group regardless of visual condition. In addition, results of conventional COM variables indicated that only the YC group produced significantly faster sway velocity and greater standard deviation than the YA group. All the results together suggest that children at 6-10 years of age use a similar variability-partitioning strategy (a greater V(UCM) and a smaller V(ORT)) like young adults in quiet stance to facilitate the COM control, but it takes more than 10 years for children to refine this strategy and achieve an adult-like variability-partitioning capability (i.e., UCM ratio). It also suggests that postural development may include two phases in which children learn to regulate the position and movement of multiple body segments and the COM first and gain an adult-like variability-partitioning capability later.},

In this study, it is shown that the classical Geweke's spectral causality measure can be explicitly linked with the output spectra of corresponding restricted and unrestricted time-domain models. The latter representation is then generalized to nonlinear bivariate signals and for the first time nonlinear causality analysis in the frequency domain. This is achieved by using the nonlinear ARX (NARX) modeling of signals, and decomposition of the recently defined output frequency response function which is related to the NARX model.},

abstract = {We constructed a physiologically realistic model of a lower-limb, mammalian muscle spindle composed of mathematical elements closely related to the anatomical components found in the biological spindle. The spindle model incorporates three nonlinear intrafusal fiber models (bag(1), bag(2), and chain) that contribute variously to action potential generation of primary and secondary afferents. A single set of model parameters was optimized on a number of data sets collected from feline soleus muscle, accounting accurately for afferent activity during a variety of ramp, triangular, and sinusoidal stretches. We also incorporated the different temporal properties of fusimotor activation as observed in the twitchlike chain fibers versus the toniclike bag fibers. The model captures the spindle's behavior both in the absence of fusimotor stimulation and during activation of static or dynamic fusimotor efferents. In the case of simultaneous static and dynamic fusimotor efferent stimulation, we demonstrated the importance of including the experimentally observed effect of partial occlusion. The model was validated against data that originated from the cat's medial gastrocnemius muscle and were different from the data used for the parameter determination purposes. The validation record included recently published experiments in which fusimotor efferent and spindle afferent activities were recorded simultaneously during decerebrate locomotion in the cat. This model will be useful in understanding the role of the muscle spindle and its fusimotor control during both natural and pathological motor behavior.},

Young and elderly subjects maintained a quiet standing position on a force platform. They also performed a force-matching task with unilateral isometric plantar flexion. A positive correlation was found in young and elderly adults between the coefficient of variation (CV) of center of pressure during quiet standing and the CV of force during plantar flexion only at contraction intensities of < or =5{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum voluntary contraction that corresponded to muscle activity during quiet standing. The electromyogram power in the medial gastrocnemius was greater in the elderly than in young adults by approximately 10 Hz during quiet standing and at low contraction intensities during plantar flexion. Fluctuations in motor output during low-intensity plantar flexion were associated with postural sway during quiet standing in both young and elderly adults.},

abstract = {It is known that muscle spindles provide the majority of information about limb position, but little is known about how position sense is computed from their signals. We have developed a family of musculoskeletal models in order to determine some of the fundamental properties associated with transforming noisy spindle information into putative internal coordinate frames for position sense. A two-joint model was developed containing one biarticular and two monoarticular muscles with a total of 1000 sensors distributed among them. The sensors were assumed to function like spindle secondary afferents under fusimotor control designed to optimize their ability to encode static position in the presence of constant output noise. The optimal distribution of sensors was found to depend strongly on the coordinate frame in which position was measured (intersegmental angle, segment orientation, or end-point of the limb) and on the topology of the biarticular muscle with respect to the plane of motion. A similar analysis was performed for an anthropometric model of the human arm, using previously published counts of muscle spindles. In general, the actual distribution of spindles about the elbow and shoulder does not seem to favor any single coordinate frame for position sense. We also looked at the potential accuracy in detecting changes in joint angles based on the distribution of muscle spindles throughout the human body. The distribution of spindles about individual joints accounts well for psychophysical data showing a proximodistal descending gradient of angular resolution that partially reflects the relative importance of more proximal joints for determining the location of the end-point.},

Similarly, the ability to repopulate the liver with disease-resistant hepatocytes offers new opportunities for correcting genetic disorders and treating patients with chronic liver disease. Recent advances concerning the fate of transplanted cells in the recipient liver, the efficacy of cell therapy in outstanding animal models of human disease. and the isolation of progenitor liver cells capable of differentiating into mature hepatocytes have renewed optimism in regard to treating people with hepatocyte transplantation. Recruitment of an increasing number of investigators to the field and the success of recent pilot studies indicate that hepatocyte transplantation will become routine clinical practice in the near future.},

abstract = {A model of isometric force production by skeletal muscle was developed in which the response to each stimulus in a train was described by a critically damped, linear second-order system. The parameters describing the system were constrained to be constant within an interstimulus interval, but were allowed to vary between interstimulus intervals. The ability of this model to match experimental data, and the time variation in the parameters (low-frequency gain and natural frequency) required to do so were examined in soleus and plantaris muscles of the cat stimulated by synchronous whole-nerve stimulation. The model produced good fits across firing rates from twitch to tetanus for slow and fast muscle, rested and fatigued, muscle, and maximal and submaximal stimulation. Both gain and natural frequency generally varied smoothly and predictably under all conditions. Gain increased at intermediate stimulation rates and in potentiated muscle, and decreased with fatigue and submaximal stimulation. Natural frequency was higher in fast muscle, and decreased with stimulation rate and fatigue. This modeling approach may provide a useful alternative to current models of skeletal muscle force, as its implementation is simple and it can describe force under conditions (fatigue, potentiation) where the muscle dynamics change with time.},

@article{Casson2010,
abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a classic noninvasive method for measuring a person's brain waves and is used in a large number of fields: from epilepsy and sleep disorder diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Electrodes are placed on the scalp to detect the microvolt-sized signals that result from synchronized neuronal activity within the brain. Current long-term EEG monitoring is generally either carried out as an inpatient in combination with video recording and long cables to an amplifier and recording unit or is ambulatory. In the latter, the EEG recorder is portable but bulky, and in principle, the subject can go about their normal daily life during the recording. In practice, however, this is rarely the case. It is quite common for people undergoing ambulatory EEG monitoring to take time off work and stay at home rather than be seen in public with such a device. Wearable EEG is envisioned as the evolution of ambulatory EEG units from the bulky, limited lifetime devices available today to small devices present only on the head that can record EEG for days, weeks, or months at a time. Such miniaturized units could enable prolonged monitoring of chronic conditions such as epilepsy and greatly improve the end-user acceptance of BCI systems. In this article, we aim to provide a review and overview of wearable EEG technology, answering the questions: What is it, why is it needed, and what does it entail? We first investigate the requirements of portable EEG systems and then link these to the core applications of wearable EEG technology: epilepsy diagnosis, sleep disorder diagnosis, and BCIs. As a part of our review, we asked 21 neurologists (as a key user group) for their views on wearable EEG. This group highlighted that wearable EEG will be an essential future tool. Our descriptions here will focus mainly on epilepsy and the medical applications of wearable EEG, as this is the historical background of the EEG, our area of expertise, and a core motivating area in itself, but we will also discuss the other application areas. We continue by considering the forthcoming research challenges, principally new electrode technology and lower power electronics, and we outline our approach for dealing with the electronic power issues. We believe that the optimal approach to realizing wearable EEG technology is not to optimize any one part but to find the best set of tradeoffs at both the system and implementation level. In this article, we discuss two of these tradeoffs in detail: investigating the online compression of EEG data to reduce the system power consumption and the optimal method for providing this data compression.},

abstract = {Although changes in the soleus H-reflex (an electrical analog of the tendon jerk) with age have been examined in a number of studies, some controversy remains. Also, the effect of age on inhibitory reflexes has received little attention. The purpose of this paper was to examine some excitatory and inhibitory reflexes systematically in healthy human subjects having a wide range of ages. We confirmed that both the maximum H-reflex (H-max) and the maximum M-wave (M-max) (from direct stimulation of motor axons) decrease gradually with age. The decrease in H-max was larger so the H-max/M-max ratio decreased dramatically with age. Interestingly, the modulation of the H-reflex during walking was essentially the same at all ages, suggesting that the pathways that modulate the H-reflex amplitude during walking are relatively well preserved during the aging process. We showed for the first time that the short-latency, reciprocal inhibitory pathways from the common. peroneal nerve to soleus muscle and from the tibial nerve to the tibialis anterior muscle also decreased with age, when measured as a depression of ongoing voluntary activity. These results suggest that there may be a general decrease in excitability of spinal pathways with age. Thus, the use of age-matched controls is particularly important in assessing, abnormalities resulting from disorders that occur primarily in the elderly.},

abstract = {In this study, we derive the hyperbolic force-velocity relation of concentric muscular contraction, first formulated empirically by A.V. Hill in 1938, from three essential model assumptions: (1) the structural assembly of three well-known elements - i.e. active, parallel damping, and serial - fulfilling a force equilibrium, (2) the parallel damping coefficient explicitly depending on muscle force output and three parameters, and (3) the kinematic gearing ratio between active and serial element being assigned to a parameter. The energy source within the muscle represented by the force of the active element is an additional fifth parameter. As a result we find the Hill "constants" A and B as functions of our five model parameters. Using A and B values from literature on experimental data, we predict heat power release of our model. By calculating enthalpy rate and mechanical efficiency, we compare the model heat power to predictions from another Hill-type model, to Hill's original findings, and to findings from modern muscle heat measurements. We reconsider why the biggest share of heat rate during isometric contractions (maintenance heat) and the velocity-dependent heat rate during concentric contractions in addition to maintenance heat rate (shortening heat rate) may be traced back to the same mechanism represented by the kinematic gearing ratio. Namely, we suggest that the serial element transfers attachment-detachment fluctuations of actin-myosin crossbridges within one sarcomere to others in the same sarcomere and to those in parallel and in series. Numerically, in case of negligible passive muscular damping, we find the ratio between A and isometric force (relative A) to depend exclusively on the kinematic gearing ratio, whereas the maintenance heat rate scales with the square of relative A. Moreover, this mechanical coupling internal to the muscle fibres may also be behind the macroscopic force dependency of the overall parallel damping coefficient.},

@article{Maltenfort1998,
abstract = {A simulation of spinal motoneurons and Renshaw cells was constructed to examine possible functions of recurrent inhibition. Recurrent inhibitory feedback via Renshaw cells is known to be weak. In our model, consistent with this, motoneuron firing was only reduced by a few pulses per second. Our initial hypothesis was that Renshaw cells would suppress synchronous firings of motoneurons caused by shared, dynamic inputs. Each motoneuron received an identical pattern of noise in its input. Synchrony coefficients were defined as the average motoneuron population firing relative to the activity of selected reference motoneurons; positive coefficients resulted if the motoneuron population was particularly active at the same time the reference motoneuron was active. With or without recurrent inhibition, the motoneuron pools tended to show little if any synchronization. Recurrent inhibition was expected to reduce the synchrony even further. Instead, it reduced the variance of the synchrony coefficients, without a comparable effect on the average. This suggests-surprisingly-that both positive and negative correlations between motoneurons are suppressed by recurrent inhibition. In short, recurrent inhibition may operate as a negative feedback mechanism to decorrelate motoneurons linked by common inputs. A consequence of this decorrelation is the suppression of spectral activity that apparently arises from correlated motoneuron firings due to common excitatory drive. Without recurrent inhibition, the power spectrum of the total motoneuron pool firings showed a peak at a frequency corresponding to the largest measured firing rates of motoneurons in the pool. Recurrent inhibition either reduced or abolished this peak, presumably by minimizing the likelihood of correlated firing among pool elements. Renshaw cells may act to diminish physiological tremor, by removing oscillatory components from aggregate motoneuron activity. Recurrent inhibition also improved coherence between the aggregate motoneuron output and the common drive, at frequencies above the frequency of the "synchronous" peak. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the spectral effect became stronger as the duration of inhibitory synaptic conductance was shortened with either the magnitude or the spatial extent of the inhibitory conductances increased to maintain constant net inhibition. Overall, Renshaw inhibition appears to be a powerful way to adjust the dynamic behavior of a neuron population with minimal impact on its static gain.},

abstract = {It has been well documented that the 15- to 35-Hz oscillatory activity of the sensorimotor cortex shows coherence with the muscle activity during weak to moderate steady contraction. To investigate the muscle dependency of the corticomuscular coherence and its training-related alterations, we quantified the coherence between electroencephalogram (EEG) from the sensorimotor cortex and rectified electromyogram (EMG) from five upper limb (first dorsal interosseous, flexor carpi radialis, extensor carpi radialis, biceps brachii, triceps brachii) and four lower limb muscles (soleus, tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, rectus femoris), while maintaining a constant force level at 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximal voluntary contraction of each muscle, in 24 untrained, 12 skill-trained (ballet dancers), and 10 strength-trained (weightlifters) individuals. Data from untrained subjects demonstrated the muscle dependency of corticomuscular coherence. The magnitude of the EEG-EMG coherence was significantly greater in the distally located lower limb muscles, such as the soleus and tibialis anterior, than in the upper or other lower limb muscles in untrained subjects (P < 0.05). These results imply that oscillatory coupling between the sensorimotor cortex and spinal motoneurons during steady contraction differs among muscles, according to the functional role of each muscle. In addition, the ballet dancers and weightlifters showed smaller EEG-EMG coherences than the untrained subjects, especially in the lower limb muscles (P < 0.05). These results indicate that oscillatory interaction between the sensorimotor cortex and spinal motoneurons can be changed by long-term specialized use of the muscles and that this neural adaptation may lead to finer control of muscle force during steady contraction.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of aging and localized muscle fatigue on the neural control of upright stance during small postural perturbations. Sixteen young (aged 18-24 years) and 16 older (aged 55-74 years) participants were exposed to small magnitude, anteriorly-directed postural perturbations before and after fatiguing exercises (lumbar extensors and ankle plantar flexors). A single degree of freedom model of the human body was used to simulate recovery kinematics following the perturbations. Central to the model was a simulated neural controller that multiplied time-delayed kinematics by invariant feedback gains. Feedback gains and time delay were optimized for each participant based on measured kinematics, and a novel delay margin analysis was performed to assess system robustness. A 10.9{\{}{\%}{\}} longer effective time delay ( p = 0.010) was found among the older group, who also showed a greater reliance upon velocity feedback information (31.1{\{}{\%}{\}} higher differential gain, p = 0.001) to control upright stance. Based on delay margins, older participants adopted a more robust control scheme to accommodate the small perturbations, potentially compensating for longer time delays or degraded sensory feedback. No fatigue-induced changes in neural controller gains, time delay, or delay margin were found in either age group, indicating that integration of this feedback information was not altered by muscle fatigue. The sensitivity of this approach to changes with fatigue may have been limited by model simplifications.},

The searching result of MS is fed back as the measurement of the adaptive KF, and the estimate parameters of KF are adjusted by the Bhattacharyya coefficient adaptively. The proposed method has the robust ability to track a moving object in consecutive frames under certain real-world complex situations, such as a moving object disappearing partially or totally due to occlusion, fast moving objects, and sudden changes in velocity of a moving object.

abstract = {Evidence is presented that one locus of adaptation in the "neural adaptations to training" is at the level of the alpha-motoneurons. With increased voluntary activity, these neurons show evidence of dendrite restructuring, increased protein synthesis, increased axon transport of proteins, enhanced neuromuscular transmission dynamics, and changes in electrophysiological properties. The latter include hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and voltage threshold, increased rate of action potential development, and increased amplitude of the afterhyperpolarization following the action potential. Many of these changes demonstrate intensity-related adaptations and are in the opposite direction under conditions in which chronic activity is reduced. A five-compartment model of rat motoneurons that innervate fast and slow muscle fibers (termed "fast" and "slow" motoneurons in this paper), including 10 active ion conductances, was used to attempt to reproduce exercise training-induced adaptations in electrophysiological properties. The results suggest that adaptations in alpha-motoneurons with exercise training may involve alterations in ion conductances, which may, in turn, include changes in the gene expression of the ion channel subunits, which underlie these conductances. Interestingly, the acute neuromodulatory effects of monoamines on motoneuron properties, which would be a factor during acute exercise as these monoaminergic systems are activated, appear to be in the opposite direction to changes measured in endurance-trained motoneurons that are at rest. It may be that regular increases in motoneuronal excitability during exercise via these monoaminergic systems in fact render the motoneurons less excitable when at rest. More research is required to establish the relationships between exercise training, resting and exercise motoneuron excitability, ion channel modulation, and the effects of neuromodulators.},

abstract = {This review focuses on investigations by Sir John Eccles and co-workers in Canberra, AUS in the 1950s, in which they used intracellular recordings to unravel the organization of neuronal networks in the cat spinal cord. Five classical spinal reflexes are emphasized: recurrent inhibition of motoneurons via motor axon collaterals and Renshaw cells, pathways from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, presynaptic inhibition, and the flexor reflex. To set the scene for these major achievements I first provide a brief account of the understanding of the spinal cord in "reflex" and "voluntary" motor activities from the beginning of the 20th century. Next, subsequent work is reviewed on the convergence on spinal interneurons from segmental sensory afferents and descending motor pathways, much of which was performed and inspired by Anders Lundberg's group in Gothenburg, SWE. This work was the keystone for new hypotheses on the role of spinal circuits in normal motor control. Such hypotheses were later tested under more natural conditions; either by recording directly from interneurons in reduced animal preparations or by use of indirect non-invasive techniques in humans performing normal movements. Some of this latter work is also reviewed. These developments would not have been possible without the preceding work on spinal reflexes by Eccles and Lundberg. Finally, there is discussion of how Eccles' work on spinal reflexes remains central (1) as new techniques are introduced on direct recording from interneurons in behaving animals; (2) in experiments on plastic neuronal changes in relation to motor learning and neurorehabilitation; (3) in experiments on transgenic animals uncovering aspects of human pathophysiology; and (4) in evaluating the function of genetically identified classes of neurons in studies on the development of the spinal cord.

However, the nature, amount and impact of noise in the nervous system have only recently been addressed in a quantitative manner. Experimental and computational methods have shown that multiple noise sources contribute to cellular and behavioural trial-to-trial variability. We review the sources of noise in the nervous system, from the molecular to the behavioural level, and show how noise contributes to trial-to-trial variability. We highlight how noise affects neuronal networks and the principles the nervous system applies to counter detrimental effects of noise, and briefly discuss noise's potential benefits.},

abstract = {The Hoffmann (or H) reflex is considered a major probe for non-invasive study of sensorimotor integration and plasticity of the central nervous system in humans. The first section of this paper reviews the neurophysiological properties of the H-reflex, which if ignored create serious pitfalls in human experimental studies. The second section reviews the spinal inhibitory circuits and neuronal pathways that can be indirectly assessed in humans using the H-reflex. The most confounding factor is that reciprocal, presynaptic, and lb inhibition do not act in isolation during movement. Therefore, characterization of these spinal circuits should be more comprehensive, especially in cases of a neurological injury because neurophysiological findings are critical for the development of successful rehabilitation protocols. To conclude, the H-reflex is a highly sensitive reflex with an amplitude that is the result of complex neural mechanisms that act synchronously. If these limitations are recognized and addressed, the H-reflex constitutes one of the major probes to assess excitability of interneuronal circuits at rest and during movement in humans.

abstract = {On the deep anterior surface of the human soleus muscle a bipenniform part is found, the portio anterior, which is innervated by the ramus anterior. This part and the innervation pattern are morphological characteristics peculiar to man. In six human soleus muscles plus three anomalies, the intramuscular distribution of the nerves supplying these muscles was macroscopically examined. In the normal soleus muscles, the R. anterior supplied not only the portio anterior but also the portio posterior through several anastomoses with twigs of the R. posterior. In the soleus without the portio anterior, the R. anterior entered the muscle at the anterior surface and joined directly with the branches of the R. posterior. In the soleus with two bipenniform parts, one bipenniform part was supplied by the R. anterior, and the other by the R. posterior. The cross-sectional area of the total nerves supplying the muscle was 0.72 +/- 0.036 mm2 (n = 8). The areas of the R. posterior and the R. anterior were in inverse relation to each other. These findings suggest that the R. anterior became separated from the R. posterior. However, the endoperineurium fiber composition of the R. anterior appeared to consist of a few nerve fiber components different from those of the R. posterior.},

abstract = {The extracellular morphology of single muscle fiber action potentials (SMFAPs) is anticipated by volume conductor theory to be triphasic. Single muscle fiber action potentials recorded during single muscle fiber studies (500 Hz to 20 kHz) usually appear triphasic; however, when recorded with an open bandwidth (1 Hz to 20 kHz) they are found to be biphasic. Fibrillation potentials recorded with a single fiber electrode and open bandwidth have identical biphasic morphologies as volitional SMFAPs. Computer simulations suggest that the intracellular action potential models currently used to derive simulated extracellularly recorded SMFAPs must have the repolarization phase considerably prolonged to yield the clinically recorded potentials. This implies that either the models presently used require significant modification, or there is some distortion of the transmembrane source current induced in needle recording studies such that biphasic and not triphasic potentials are detected.

abstract = {One approach to conveying tactile feedback from sensorized neural prostheses is to characterize the neural signals that would normally be produced in an intact limb and reproduce them through electrical stimulation of the residual peripheral nerves. Toward this end, we have developed a model that accurately replicates the neural activity evoked by any dynamic stimulus in the three types of mechanoreceptive afferents that innervate the glabrous skin of the hand. The model takes as input the position of the stimulus as a function of time, along with its first (velocity), second (acceleration), and third (jerk) derivatives. This input is filtered and passed through an integrate-and-fire mechanism to generate a train of spikes as output. The major conclusion of this study is that the timing of individual spikes evoked in mechanoreceptive fibers innervating the hand can be accurately predicted by this model. We discuss how this model can be integrated in a sensorized prosthesis and show that the activity in a population of simulated afferents conveys information about the location, timing, and magnitude of contact between the hand and an object.},

abstract = {Corticomuscular interactions are studied mostly with EEG/EMG coherence, which, however, does not allow quantification of amplitude dynamics of sensorimotor oscillations. Here, we investigated the amplitude dynamics of sensorimotor EEG beta oscillations during an isometric task and their relation to corticomuscular coherence (CMC). We used amplitude envelopes of beta oscillations, derived from multichannel EEG and EMG recordings, as a measure of local cortical and spinal-cord synchronization. In general, we showed that the amplitude of cortical beta oscillations can influence CMC in two ways. First, we showed that the signal-to-noise ratio of pre-stimulus beta oscillations affects CMC. Second, we demonstrated that the attenuation of beta oscillations upon imperative stimulus correlated with the CMC strength. Attenuation of cortical beta oscillations was previously hypothesized to reflect increased motor cortex excitability. Consequently, this correlation might indicate that high cortical excitability, produced by imperative stimulus, facilitates the recruitment of neuronal networks responsible for establishing reliable corticospinal control manifested in larger CMC. Critically, we demonstrated that the amplitude envelopes of beta oscillations in EEG and EMG are positively correlated on time scales ranging from 50 to 1000 ms. Such correlations indicate that the amplitude of cortical beta oscillations might relate to the rhythmic spiking output of both corticospinal neurons and their spinal targets. Compared to CMC, however, amplitude-envelope correlations were detected in fewer cases, which might relate to a higher susceptibility of these correlations to signal-to-noise ratio. We conclude that EEG beta oscillations, originating from the sensorimotor cortex, can transmit not only their phase but also amplitude dynamics through the spinal motoneurons down to peripheral effectors.},

abstract = {During human walking, a sudden trip may elicit a Ia afferent fibre mediated short latency stretch reflex. The aim of this study was to investigate soleus (SOL) muscle mechanical behaviour in response to dorsiflexion perturbations, and to relate this behaviour to short latency stretch reflex responses. Twelve healthy subjects walked on a treadmill with the left leg attached to an actuator capable of rapidly dorsiflexing the ankle joint. Ultrasound was used to measure fascicle lengths in SOL during walking, and surface electromyography (EMG) was used to record muscle activation. Dorsiflexion perturbations of 6 deg were applied during mid-stance at walking speeds of 3, 4 and 5 km h(-1). At each walking speed, perturbations were delivered at three different velocities (slow: similar to 170 deg s(-1), mid: similar to 230 deg s(-1), fast: similar to 280 deg s(-1)). At 5 km h(-1), fascicle stretch amplitude was 34-40{\%} smaller and fascicle stretch velocity 22-28{\%} slower than at 3 km h(-1) in response to a constant amplitude perturbation, whilst stretch reflex amplitudes were unchanged. Changes in fascicle stretch parameters can be attributed to an increase in muscle stiffness at faster walking speeds. As stretch velocity is a potent stimulus to muscle spindles, a decrease in the velocity of fascicle stretch at faster walking speeds would be expected to decrease spindle afferent feedback and thus stretch reflex amplitudes, which did not occur. It is therefore postulated that other mechanisms, such as altered fusimotor drive, reduced pre-synaptic inhibition and/or increased descending excitatory input, acted to maintain motoneurone output as walking speed increased, preventing a decrease in short latency reflex amplitudes.},

abstract = {Movement-related processing results in the modulation of neuronal synchronization over several electroencephalography (EEG) frequency ranges, including alpha- (8-12 Hz) and beta-band (14-30 Hz). Whether modulation patterns differ across sites within the motor system remains unclear, but could denote how information is conveyed across the cortico-basal network. We therefore compared the event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) in recordings from the scalp, basal ganglia and thalamic structures during a motor task. Simultaneous depth and scalp EEG were recorded in 13 patients, undergoing deep brain stimulation of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) or the subthalamic nucleus (STN). They performed a choice-reaction task with pre-cued Go-signals, instructive for either left- or right-sided button presses. In the beta-band, pre-cues and Go-signals were followed by ERD starting well before and peaking at task execution, uniformly in all cortical and subcortical recordings. In contrast, a comparable alpha-band ERD was only seen at the scalp, whereas mirror-like ERS were observed in the motor-inhibitory STN. In VIM, which receives strong somatosensory afferences, a major alpha-ERD upon the Go-signal did not start until the motor response. These dissociations of task-related Alpha- and Beta-band dynamics tag a functional diversity in cortico-basal networks, which are simultaneously active in motor processing. Whereas the uniform downregulation of Beta-activity points to an anti-kinetic operation mode throughout the motor system, site-dependent courses of Alpha-synchronization rather reflect the coordination of activity levels in functionally divergent motor structures during the preparation and execution of movements.},

abstract = {In sensory systems, the presence of a particular nonzero level of noise may significantly enhance the ability of an individual to detect weak sensory stimuli through a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). The aim of this study was to demonstrate if such phenomenon is also exhibited by the motor system; in particular, in the Ia-motoneuron synapse of the cat spinal cord. Monosynaptic reflexes elicited by periodic electrical stimulation to the medial gastrocnemius nerve were recorded in the L(7) ventral root (or in single motoneurons) of decerebrated cats. Random stretches (mechanical noise) were applied to the lateral gastrocnemius plus soleus muscle by means of a closed-loop mechanical stimulator-transducer. In all cats, we observed the SR phenomenon. The amplitude of the monosynaptic reflexes (or number of action potentials recorded in the motoneurons) evoked by the weak electrical stimuli applied to the medial gastrocnemius nerve were an inverted U-like function of the mechanical noise applied to the lateral gastrocnemius plus soleus muscle. A significant maximum value in the amplitude of the monosynaptic responses was reached with a particular noise amplitude value. Numerical simulations on a model of the monosynaptic reflex pathway qualitatively reproduce this stochastic resonance behavior. We conclude that the monosynaptic reflex response elicited by Ia afferents is optimized by the noisy stretching of a synergistic muscle. Our study provides the first direct demonstration that the motor system, and not only the sensory systems, exhibits the SR phenomenon.},

This review focuses on the pathogenic mechanisms of channelopathies affecting skeletal muscle and brain arising from mutations of voltage-gated ion channels and fast ligand-gated ion channels expressed at the surface membrane. Derangements in channel function alter the electrical excitability of the cell and thereby increase susceptibility to transient symptomatic attacks including myasthenia, periodic paralysis, myotonic stiffness, seizures, headache, 'dyskinesia, or episodic ataxia. Although these disorders are rare, they stand out as exemplary cases for which disease pathogenesis can be traced from a point mutation to altered protein function, to altered cellular activity, and to clinical phenotype. The study of these disorders has provided insights on channel structure-function relations, the physiological roles of ion channels, and rational approaches toward therapeutic intervention for many disorders of cellular excitability.},

abstract = {Our goal was to provide some insights into how the CNS controls and maintains an upright standing posture, which is an integral part of activities of daily living. Although researchers have used simple performance measures of maintenance of this posture quite effectively in clinical decision making, the mechanisms and control principles involved have not been clear. We propose a relatively simple control scheme for regulation of upright posture that provides almost instantaneous corrective response and reduces the operating demands on the CNS. The analytic model is derived and experimentally validated. A stiffness model was developed for quiet standing. The model assumes that muscles act as springs to cause the center-of-pressure (COP) to move in phase with the center-of-mass (COM) as the body sways about some desired position. In the sagittal plane this stiffness control exists at the ankle plantarflexors, in the frontal plane by the hip abductors/adductors. On the basis of observations that the COP-COM error signal continuously oscillates, ii. is evident that the inverted pendulum model is severely underdamped, approaching the undamped condition. The spectrum of this error signal is seen to match that of a tuned mass, spring, damper system, and a curve fit of this "tuned circuit" yields omega(n) the undamped natural frequency of the system. The effective stiffness of the system, K-e, is then estimated from K-e = I omega(n)(2), and the damping B is estimated from B = BW x I, where BW is the bandwidth of the tuned response (in rad/s), and I is the moment of inertia of the body about the ankle joint. Ten adult subjects were assessed while standing quietly at three stance widths: 50{\%} hip-to-hip distance, 100 and 150{\%}. Subjects stood for 2 min in each position with eyes open; the 100{\%} stance width was repeated with eyes closed. In all trials and in both planes, the COP oscillated virtually in phase (within 6 ms) with COM, which was predicted by a simple 0th order spring model. Sway amplitude decreased as stance width increased, and K-e increased with stance width. A stiffness model would predict sway to vary as K-e(-0.5). Th, experimental results were close to this prediction: sway was proportional to k(e)(-0.59). Reactive control of balance was not evident for several reasons. The visual system does not appear to contribute because no significant difference between eyes open and eyes closed results was found at 100{\%} stance width. Vestibular (otolith) and joint proprioceptive reactive control were discounted because the necessary head accelerations, joint displacements, and velocities were well below reported thresholds. Besides, any reactive control would predict that COP would considerably lag (150-250 ms) behind the COM. Because the average COP was only 4 ms delayed behind the COM, reactive control was not evident; this small delay was accounted for by the damping in the tuned mechanical system.},

abstract = {A comparison of previously defined spike train syncrhonization indices is undertaken within a stochastic point process framework. The second-order cumulant density (covariance density) is shown to be common to all the indices. Simulation studies were used to investigate the sampling variability of a single index based on the second-order cumulant. The simulations used a paired motoneurone model and a paired regular spiking cortical neurone model. The sampling variability of spike trains generated under identical conditions from the paired motoneurone model varied from 50{\%} to 160{\%} of the estimated value. On theoretical grounds, and on the basis of simulated data a rate dependence is present in all synchronization indices. The application of coherence and pooled coherence estimates to the issue of synchronization indices is considered. This alternative frequency domain approach allows an arbitrary number of spike train pairs to be evaluated for statistically significant differences, and combined into a single population measure. The pooled coherence framework allows pooled time domain measures to be derived, application of this to the simulated data is illustrated. Data from the cortical neurone model is generated over a wide range of firing rates (1-250 spikes/s). The pooled coherence framework correctly characterizes the sampling variability as not significant over this wide operating range. The broader applicability of this approach to multielectrode array data is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {1. The electrical activity of single motor units has been recorded from the first dorsal interosseus muscle of normal human subjects during voluntary, isometric contractions, together with the force generated by the muscle.2. By averaging the force correlated with the impulses from a single motor unit, the contraction time and twitch tension generated by that motor unit could be measured. When the rate of discharge was limited, either voluntarily or by automatic selection of intervals for analysis, the time for the tension to decline to half its maximum value (half-relaxation time) could also be measured for some motor units.3. Under our experimental conditions the trains of impulses from different motor units in most subjects were generated quite independently as tested by (a) measuring the correlation between activity in single units and that in the whole muscle as recorded by the surface electromyogram (e.m.g.), (b) measuring the cross-correlations between pairs of single units and (c) comparing the tension generated by stimulating single motor units with the average tension correlated in time with voluntary activity of single units in the same location.4. In one normal subject evidence of synchronization between separate motor units was obtained. Cross-correlation studies suggested that the cause of the synchronization was the presence of substantial common excitation received by the various motor units in the muscle.5. The frequency response for the contractions of single motor units was well fitted by that for a linear, second-order system with nearly critical damping. However, when stimulation of a few motor units was superimposed on a voluntary contraction, underdamped (oscillatory) responses were seen which were probably of reflex origin.6. The significance of these results in relation to the normal postural tremor in hand muscles is discussed.},

@article{Matthews1996,
abstract = {1. Interspike interval distributions from human motor units of a variety of muscles were analysed to assess the role of synaptic noise in excitation. The time course of the underlying post-spike after-hyperpolarization (AHP) was deduced by applying a specially developed transform to the interval data. Different firing rates were studied both by varying the firing voluntarily and by selecting subpopulations of spikes for a given firing rate from long recordings with slight variations in frequency. 2. At low firing rates the interval histograms had an exponential tail. Thus at long intervals, the motoneurone was randomly excited by noise and its post-spike AHP was complete. This contrasts with the firing produced by intracellular current injection in the cat, when the membrane potential increases linearly until threshold is reached. The interval histogram was therefore analysed with the aid of a model of synaptic excitation to deduce the mean 'trajectory' of membrane voltage in the last part of the interspike interval. 3. The computer model, described in the Appendix, was used to determine the effect of the mean level of membrane potential on the probability of a spike being excited, per unit time, during an on-going interspike interval. All variables were treated as voltages, with synaptic noise simulated by time-smoothed Gaussian noise. This enabled an interval distribution to be transformed into a segment of the underlying trajectory of the membrane potential; the potential was expressed in terms of the noise amplitude and the spike threshold. 4. At low firing rates, the equilibrium value of the membrane voltage trajectory lay well below threshold; the deviation typically corresponded to the standard deviation of the noise or more. The noise standard deviation was estimated to be about 2 mV. 5. With increasing mean firing rate, the near-threshold portion of the trajectory obtainable from the histogram occurred earlier, was steeper and rose to a higher level. Trajectories for different firing rates fell on the same curve after shifting them vertically by varying amounts. The curve was taken to represent the AHP of the motoneurone and was closely exponential. The shift of the trajectory gave its mean synaptic drive. The duration of the AHP varied between units and was longer than average for units from soleus muscle. 6. Further modelling showed that summation of noise with the AHP can explain the well-known changes in discharge variability that occur as firing rate increases. 7. It is concluded that synaptic noise plays a major role in the excitation of tonically firing human motoneurones and that the noiseless motoneurone with a linear trajectory provides an inadequate model for the conscious human. This is of interest in relation to various standard measures of human motor unit activity such as short-term synchronization.},

abstract = {The influence of the recording site on the motor unit potentials (MUPs) was investigated in the brachial biceps muscle of 8 healthy subjects. The MUPs were recorded with a concentric needle electrode and analyzed with a new decomposition EMG program we call multi-MUP analysis. MUPs had shorter durations and smaller amplitudes at superficial recording sites than at deeper sites in the muscle, This is mainly due to the cannula of the concentric electrode, which records a higher potential at superficial recording sites and partially cancels the recorded potentials from the tip in a differential recording, The MUPs had longer durations and higher amplitudes distally than in the middle of the muscle, The longer durations and spike durations are probably due to increased temporal dispersion at a greater distance from the endplate zone. We do not have an adequate explanation for the larger amplitudes distally in the biceps, they may be due to anatomical factors, To increase the diagnostic sensitivity of quantitative MUP analysis the recordings should be obtained from standardized recording sites.

abstract = {This article reviews the evidence for cortical involvement in shaping postural responses evoked by external postural perturbations. Although responses to postural perturbations occur more quickly than the fastest voluntary movements, they have longer latencies than spinal stretch reflexes, suggesting greater potential for modification by the cortex. Postural responses include short, medium and long latency components of muscle activation with increasing involvement of the cerebral cortex as latencies increase. Evidence suggests that the cortex is also involved in changing postural responses with alterations in cognitive state, initial sensory-motor conditions, prior experience, and prior warning of a perturbation, all representing changes in "central set." Studies suggest that the cerebellar-cortical loop is responsible for adapting postural responses based on prior experience and the basal ganglia-cortical loop is responsible for pre-selecting and optimizing postural responses based on current context. Thus, the cerebral cortex likely influences longer latency postural responses both directly via corticospinal loops and shorter latency postural responses indirectly via communication with the brainstem centers that harbor the synergies for postural responses, thereby providing both speed and flexibility for pre-selecting and modifying environmentally appropriate responses to a loss of balance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to control balance is often compromised in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is considered to be a strong contributing factor toward their increased risk of falls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nNEW METHOD: The aim of the study was to demonstrate that frequency analysis of postural sway could be used to investigate postural control in people with MS. Ten individuals with MS and ten age-and-gender matched healthy subjects stood on the force platform with eyes open or closed. The displacements of center of pressure (COP) were used to calculate power spectrum using fast Fourier transform. Power spectrum was analyzed for anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions using three frequency bands: 0-0.3 Hz, 0.3-1 Hz, and 1-3 Hz reflecting contributions from the visual, vestibular/somatosensory, and proprioceptive systems, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean COP velocity in the eyes closed condition was significantly larger for the MS than the healthy control group. Additionally, the MS group showed a significant decrease in the magnitude of COP power spectrum in the low frequency band and a pattern of increase in the medium and high frequency bands in the medial-lateral direction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The observed redistribution of the COP power spectrum when vision is absent indicates that people with MS relied more on the vestibular/somatosensory and proprioceptive systems. However, such a strategy change was ineffective in maintaining postural stability, thus highlighting the impaired ability of the somatosensory system in regulation of postural control in people with MS. The outcome of the study suggests that the COP frequency analysis could be used in identifying the possible sources of balance impairment in people with MS.},

@article{Ribot-Ciscar1996,
abstract = {Applying mechanical vibration for short periods to a muscle tendon induces long-lasting involuntary contractions which develop soon after the vibration offset in the previously vibrated muscle. In the present study, the question was raised as to whether these post-vibratory motor responses are mediated by the activity of supraspinal neural population or whether they may involve in addition some peripheral facilitatory influences operating at the motoneuronal level. To investigate this question, we analysed the unitary activity of 48 motor units belonging to the wrist extensor radialis muscles of the human hand, after attempting to classify them as slow or fast, during both post-vibratory and voluntary contractions having almost the same amplitudes and time-courses. The motor units were found to be activated in much the same way with both types of contraction. Similarities were observed as regards: the nature of the motor units activated, the order of recruitment of the motor unit population, the motor units' force recruitment thresholds, the mean interspike interval and the standard deviation. These analogies suggest that post-vibratory contraction may mainly involve a supraspinal tonic drive, but the possibility that these involuntary contractions may have a spinal origin cannot be completely ruled out.},

@article{Johnson2010,
abstract = {Spinal motoneurons (MNs) amplify synaptic inputs by producing strong dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs), which allow the MN to generate the firing rates and forces necessary for normal behaviors. However, PICs prolong MN depolarization after the initial excitation is removed, tend to "wind-up" with repeated activation and are regulated by a diffuse neuromodulatory system that affects all motor pools. We have shown that PICs are very sensitive to reciprocal inhibition from Ia afferents of antagonist muscles and as a result PIG amplification is related to limb configuration. Because reciprocal inhibition is tightly focused, shared only between strict anatomical antagonists, this system opposes the diffuse effects of the descending neuromodulation that facilitates PICs. Because inhibition appears necessary for PIG control, we hypothesize that la inhibition interacts with Ia excitation in a "push pull" fashion, in which a baseline of simultaneous excitation and inhibition allows depolarization to occur via both excitation and disinhibition (and vice versa for hyperpolarization). Push pull control appears to mitigate the undesirable affects associated with the PIG while still taking full advantage of PIC amplification.},

abstract = {Recently there has been an increase in the use of spectral methods for the analysis of experimental data. These analytical methods allow the study of interactions between simultaneously recorded signals and are particularly suited to the study of systems displaying rhythmic behaviour. A useful parameter in this context is the coherence function which provides a bounded measure of linear association between two signals. In this report we introduce two new techniques for dealing with an arbitrary number of independent coherence estimates. The first technique provides a test to compare the coherence estimates for statistically significant differences. The second allows the-original coherence estimates to be combined, or 'pooled' into a single representative estimate. These two measures, taken together, provide a powerful tool for characterising and summarising the correlations within data sets. Applications of the techniques are illustrated by analysing the interactions between single motor unit discharges and finger tremor, and between pairs of motor unit discharges in human subjects.},

An 8 degrees stretch was applied to the ankle extensors of the left leg in 8 healthy subjects during normal walking speed and 9 spastic MS patients and 10 age-matched healthy subjects during slow walking. When present in walking healthy subjects, M2 and M3 were modulated in a similar way and with the same amplitudes as previously described for the short latency soleus stretch reflex (M1). The spastic patients' soleus M1 was significantly less modulated during walking. The patients' M2 long-latency response was modulated in the same way as the age-matched healthy subjects. All patients' M3 responses were absent or much suppressed during walking. The origin and functional importance of the short- and long-latency stretch reflexes in healthy and spastic persons are discussed in relation to the above findings and the behaviour of the stretch reflexes during matched isometric contractions. M3 is argued to be part of a transcortical reflex in healthy subjects.},

abstract = {This study investigated corticospinal-evoked responses in lower limb muscles during voluntary contractions at varying strengths. Similar investigations have been made on upper limb muscles, where evoked responses have been shown to increase up to approximately 50{\%} of maximal force and then decline. We elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) in the soleus (Sol) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles using magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex and cervicomedullary junction during voluntary plantar flexions with the torque ranging from 0 to 100{\%} of a maximal voluntary contraction. Differences between the MEP and CMEP were also investigated to assess whether any changes were occurring at the cortical or spinal levels. In both Sol and MG, MEP and CMEP amplitudes [normalized to maximal M wave (Mmax)] showed an increase, followed by a plateau, over the greater part of the contraction range with responses increasing from approximately 0.2 to approximately 6{\%} of Mmax for Sol and from approximately 0.3 to approximately 10{\%} of Mmax for MG. Because both MEPs and CMEPs changed in a similar manner, the observed increase and lack of decrease at high force levels are likely related to underlying changes occurring at the spinal level. The evoked responses in the Sol and MG increase over a greater range of contraction strengths than for upper limb muscles, probably due to differences in the pattern of motor unit recruitment and rate coding for these muscles and the strength of the corticospinal input.},

Among these models, the adaptive integrate-and-fire model is physiologically relevant in that its parameters can be easily related to physiological quantities. The interaction of the differential equations with the reset results in a rich and complex dynamical structure. We relate the subthreshold features of the model to the dynamical properties of the differential system and the spike patterns to the properties of a Poincare map defined by the sequence of spikes. We find a complex bifurcation structure which has a direct interpretation in terms of spike trains. For some parameter values, spike patterns are chaotic.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases can have long preclinical phases and insidious progression patterns, but the mechanisms of disease progression are poorly understood. Because quantitative accounts of neuronal circuitry affected by disease have been lacking, it has remained unclear whether disease progression reflects processes of stochastic loss or temporally defined selective vulnerabilities of distinct synapses or axons. Here we derive a quantitative topographic map of muscle innervation in the hindlimb. We show that in two mouse models of motoneuron disease (G93A SOD1 and G85R SOD1), axons of fast-fatiguable motoneurons are affected synchronously, long before symptoms appear. Fast-fatigue-resistant motoneuron axons are affected at symptom-onset, whereas axons of slow motoneurons are resistant. Axonal vulnerability leads to synaptic vesicle stalling and accumulation of BC12a1-a, an anti-apoptotic protein. It is alleviated by ciliary neurotrophic factor and triggers proteasome-dependent pruning of peripheral axon branches. Thus, motoneuron disease involves predictable, selective vulnerability patterns by physiological subtypes of axons, episodes of abrupt pruning in the target region and compensation by resistant axons.},

abstract = {Although feedback models have been used to simulate body motions in human postural control, it is not known whether muscle activation patterns generated by the nervous system during postural responses can also be explained by a feedback control process. We investigated whether a simple feedback law could explain temporal patterns of muscle activation in response to support-surface translations in human subjects. Previously, we used a single-link inverted-pendulum model with a delayed feedback controller to reproduce temporal patterns of muscle activity during postural responses in cats. We scaled this model to human dimensions and determined whether it could reproduce human muscle activity during forward and backward support-surface perturbations. Through optimization, we found three feedback gains (on pendulum acceleration, velocity, and displacement) and a common time delay that allowed the model to best match measured electromyographic (EMG) signals. For each muscle and each subject, the entire time courses of EMG signals during postural responses were well reconstructed in muscles throughout the lower body and resembled the solution derived from an optimal control model. In ankle muscles, >75{\%} of the EMG variability was accounted for by model reconstructions. Surprisingly, >67{\%} of the EMG variability was also accounted for in knee, hip, and pelvis muscles, even though motion at these joints was minimal. Although not explicitly required by our optimization, pendulum kinematics were well matched to subject center-of-mass (CoM) kinematics. Together, these results suggest that a common set of feedback signals related to task-level control of CoM motion is used in the temporal formation of muscle activity during postural control.},

abstract = {During standing posture, the soleus muscles acts to control sway in the anteroposterior (AP) direction. The soleus muscles bilaterally share a common function during standing tasks. We sought to determine whether common descending inputs, as evidenced by the synchronization of bilateral motor unit pairs, were employed as a strategy to control this common function. Single motor units were recorded from the soleus muscles in subjects who stood on adjacent force platforms for 5 min with their eyes open or closed. While standing with the eyes open, only 4/39 bilateral motor unit pairs showed significant synchronization. Similarly, only 3/36 motor unit pairs were significantly synchronized during the eyes closed task. The low incidence of synchronization was observed despite a high correlation in the amount of sway in the AP direction between legs in both the eyes open and eyes closed tasks (rho = 0.80 and rho = 0.83, respectively). When the extent of synchronization was assessed between pairs of motor units within the same leg with the eyes open, 10/12 pairs were synchronized. Furthermore, when pairs of soleus motor units were recorded both bilaterally and unilaterally during voluntary isometric ankle plantarflexion, only 4/30 bilateral pairs showed significant synchronization, whereas 19/24 unilateral pairs had significant synchronization. In this study, there was little evidence of the existence of synchronization between bilateral soleus motor unit pairs in either postural tasks or voluntary isometric contractions. In cases in which bilateral synchronization was observed, it was considerably weaker than the synchronization of motor units within a single soleus muscle. The results of this study reveal that it is rather uncommon for bilateral soleus motoneurons to receive common descending synaptic inputs, whereas two motoneurons within a single soleus muscle do.},

abstract = {We studied the effect of sensory feedback on the oscillatory interaction between activity of the motor cortex and the spinal motoneuron pool during isometric contraction. After inducing ischaemic sensory deafferentation in the upper limb in six subjects, we calculated coherences between simultaneously recorded whole-scalp magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the first dorsal interosseus muscles. We expected that the dominant frequency of coherence would change if there were interaction through a sensory feedback loop. However, the MEG-EMG coherence frequency did not change significantly during ischaemia. The strength of the coherence was reduced during ischaemia, but returned to the pre-ischaemic level after ischaemia had ended. Reduction of sensory feedback may thus indirectly reduce the amount of corticomuscular coherence, but the lack of change in the dominant coherent frequency suggests that a sensory feedback loop is not essential for the generation of this coherence.},

@article{Nordstrom1992,
abstract = {1. The relationship between the motor unit discharge pattern (rate and variability) and synchronization of motor unit pairs was studied in the first dorsal interosseus muscle of human subjects. In separate trials of up to 4 min duration, subjects voluntarily controlled the mean discharge rate of an identified motor unit at one of several prescribed rates (range 7.5-17.5 Hz). 2. The effect of discharge rate on the synchronous peak in the cross-correlogram was examined in eighty motor unit pairs from six subjects. Five commonly used synchronization indices were used to quantify synchrony in the cross-correlograms constructed from different discharge-rate trials. For each synchronization index, the apparent magnitude of synchrony increased at lower motor unit discharge rates. The synchronization indices were not equally sensitive to discharge rate; increases in the different indices ranged from 72 to 494{\{}{\%}{\}} between the highest and lowest discharge rates. 3. A model of the membrane potential trajectory underlying rhythmic motoneuron discharge was used to explain the observed increase in the magnitude of the synchronization indices at lower discharge rates. The essential feature of this model is that the probability of a common-input EPSP causing a synchronous discharge in two motoneurons is independent of discharge rate. This means that the number of synchronous action potentials in excess of chance in any trial depends on the properties of the common-input EPSPs and the duration of the trial, but is not related to motor unit discharge rates. The model also demonstrated that when the excess synchronous counts are normalized to motor unit discharge rate, or baseline counts in the histogram (as in the conventional synchronization indices), the magnitude of the index increases when the motor unit discharge rates are low. 4. The strength of common input to motoneurons could be misinterpreted if conventional synchronization indices are used because of discharge-rate effects. The model was used to derive an index of the strength of common input to motoneurons (CIS) that was independent of motor unit discharge rate. CIS is the frequency of synchronous action potentials in the motor unit pair in excess of those expected due to chance (calculated during periods of tonic discharge in both units). The mean CIS in first dorsal interosseus motor unit pairs ranged from 0.052 to 1.005 extra synchronous action potentials per second across subjects. 5. Discharge variability was correlated with each of the synchronization indices and the CIS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Researchers have previously adopted the double stimulus paradigm to study refractoriness in human neuromotor control. Currently, refractoriness, such as the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) has only been quantified in discrete movement conditions. Whether refractoriness and the associated serial ballistic hypothesis generalises to sustained control tasks has remained open for more than sixty years. Recently, a method of analysis has been presented that quantifies refractoriness in sustained control tasks and discriminates intermittent (serial ballistic) from continuous control. Following our recent demonstration that continuous control of an unstable second order system (i.e. balancing a 'virtual' inverted pendulum through a joystick interface) is unnecessary, we ask whether refractoriness of substantial duration ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}200 ms) is evident in sustained visual-manual control of external systems. We ask whether the refractory duration (i) is physiologically intrinsic, (ii) depends upon system properties like the order (0, 1(st), and 2(nd)) or stability, (iii) depends upon target jump direction (reversal, same direction). Thirteen participants used discrete movements (zero order system) as well as more sustained control activity (1(st) and 2(nd) order systems) to track unpredictable step-sequence targets. Results show a substantial refractory duration that depends upon system order (250, 350 and 550 ms for 0, 1(st) and 2(nd) order respectively, n=13, p<0.05), but not stability. In sustained control refractoriness was only found when the target reverses direction. In the presence of time varying actuators, systems and constraints, we propose that central refractoriness is an appropriate control mechanism for accommodating online optimization delays within the neural circuitry including the more variable processing times of higher order (complex) input-output relations.},

This paper presents a model of the IAP waveform as the sum of a spike and an afterpotential, both represented by simple analytical expressions. The model parameters that specify the sizes of the spike and afterpotential are shown to be proportional to the quadrupole and dipole moments of the transmembrane current distribution associated with the spike of the wave of excitation. The model provides a computationally efficient method for simulating the MUAP, and it can be reliably inverted to estimate the model parameters from empirical IAP and MUAP waveforms.},

@article{Berger1984,
abstract = {The longitudinal distributions of both phrenic and medial gastrocnemius motoneurons were quantitatively studied in the cat spinal cord. Both populations of motoneurons were retrogradely labeled by applying horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to the cut central ends of the appropriate peripheral nerves. The longitudinal positions of all labeled motoneurons in each motor column were determined; these data then were used to generate longitudinal distribution histograms and spatial interval distributions (SIDs), the latter being analyzed further by means of power spectra. In three of four cats, longitudinal clustering of phrenic motoneuronal cell bodies was revealed by the presence of a narrow central peak in the SID and the presence of subsidiary peaks. In the fourth cat, only a smaller central peak was observed. Power spectral analysis of the three SIDs having subsidiary peaks revealed that the mean longitudinal distance between clusters was 0.95 mm (range 0.52 to 1.22 mm). The analyses also revealed that on average a phrenic motoneuronal cluster contained 17 motoneurons, and the mean longitudinal length of a cluster was 450 microns. Using single, small-volume injections of HRP into the diaphragm, we concluded that not all the phrenic motoneurons within a single cluster innervate muscle fibers in a discrete region of the diaphragm. Similar quantitative analysis of the distribution of medial gastrocnemius motoneurons did not reveal clustering in this motor column. We suggest that the fundamental differences in the spatial distributions of motoneurons within these two motor columns may be related to differences in the functional organizations of motoneurons innervating axial versus appendicular musculature, i.e., diaphragm versus medial gastrocnemius.},

@article{Shapiro2007,
abstract = {Motoneurons have been shown to exhibit both bistable firing and synaptic amplification. Both of these behaviors have generally been attributed to a single mechanism-dendritic plateau potentials based on L-type Ca2+ conductances. However, our recent discovery of a fast-amplification mode calls this into question. Here we examine the possibility that two mechanisms underlie these behaviors, one being a slow-mode bistability mechanism (i.e., the L-type Ca2+ conductance-based dendritic plateaus) and the other being a theoretical fast-mode amplification mechanism. A "top-down" motoneuron model that encapsulated these and other hypotheses was developed in which these mechanisms could be explored. The resulting final model simultaneously exhibits synaptic amplification, plateau potential formation, bistable firing patterns, and current-voltage (I-V) and frequency-current (F-I) hystereses. This model suggests that amplification and plateaus are mutually exclusive in the same dendrite/dendritic branch. Thus we predict that plateau generation does not occur in all dendritic branches. This could be readily accomplished by a large degree of variation in the density of L-type Ca2+ channels believed to underlie plateau formation in these cells with the added benefit of spreading plateau onset over a wider voltage range, as is observed experimentally.},

@article{Rall1992,
abstract = {We are very pleased to contribute to this special issue commemorating the pioneering research contributions of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz. All of us have been greatly influenced and encouraged by their example of using theory to design experiments that yield values for key model parameters. W. Rall was privileged to get an early glimpse of this research on the special occasion when Alan Hodgkin visited K. S. Cole at the University of Chicago, in the spring of 1948, and presented a biophysics seminar about research done at Plymouth, in September 1947, with Bernard Katz (51, 52; see Ref. 16, p. 267, and Ref. 49, p. 17). Later, W. Rall and J. J. B. Jack were in Dunedin, New Zealand, on the special occasion when J. C. Eccles reported the exciting new results and interpretations of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz that he had learned from attending a Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology (June, 1952). Thus the classic series of papers, published in the Journal of Physiology (London) in 1952, did not come as a surprise to us in Dunedin; it came rather as an impressive fulfillment of expectations already raised. The concept of separating the ionic fluxes and treating them as electric currents governed by a time-varying conductance and a time-varying difference of potential (membrane potential minus ionic reversal potential) was of critical importance. It facilitated both qualitative thinking about membrane phenomena and quantitative treatment of experimental data. This concept also was central to thinking about neuromuscular junctions (33) and synapses (19) and to the modeling of synaptic conductance transients in dendrites (97, 99). The subsequent realization of ionic conductance in terms of specific ion channels is a remarkable development that is covered in other reviews in this commemorative issue. The explicit mathematical model presented by Hodgkin and Huxley (50) provided a giant step forward in capturing the nonlinear properties of nerve membrane. The effort to increase functional insight into this class of nonlinear dynamical systems was significantly advanced by FitzHugh (35) with his introduction of a nonlinear two-variable system (cubic BVP), which captured the essential qualitative nonlinear dynamics of nerve membrane. By studying this system in a two-dimensional phase space, FitzHugh was able to distinguish different physiological states: the resting point, the active region, the refractory regions (both absolute and relative), and regions of depressed and enhanced excitability, as well as "no man's land" (35). Many valuable insights related to the physiological states of classic physiology were communicated in this paper and in an outstanding review chapter (36). Fruitful study of this reduced system (now known as the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations) has continued. For example, by using a piecewise-linear approximation to the cubic nonlinearity, Rinzel and Keller (116) succeeded in solving this system of equations explicitly, providing pulse and periodic solutions together with a rigorous analysis of the stability of these solutions. Insights gained by using the phase-plane approach of the qualitative theory of differential equations can be found in two reviews (115, 116). In addition, the impact of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations on mathematical biology and applied mathematics has been reviewed recently (114).},

abstract = {A major goal in neuroscience is to understand how the CNS controls posture and movement in humans. This requires an understanding of individual human motor unit properties and how they interact within the muscle to perform different tasks. This article describes differences and similarities between the contractile properties of human motor units and those of the cat prototype medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle, on which so many studies have been conducted. The article describes the methods available for measuring human motor unit properties and their limitations, and it discusses how far the behavior of whole muscles can be predicted from their histochemistry. It questions the extent to which human motor units conform to the conventional criteria by which S (slow, fatigue resistant), FR (fast but fatigue resistant) and FF (fast, fatigable) unit types are usually classified. An important difference between human and cat MG data is that weak human motor units are not necessarily slow, nor strong ones fast; that is, generally, human unit force is not correlated with contractile speed. Also, unlike cat MG, the few human muscles studied so far contain few if any FF units but a high proportion of units with intermediate fatigue resistance (Flnt). These apparently aberrant human properties, however, are also found in other cat and rat muscles. Thus, cat MG may not be the best model for motor unit behavior generally. Finally, the influence of human motor unit properties on force output by recruitment and/or rate coding is discussed.},

@article{Milton2009,
abstract = {The inverted pendulum is frequently used as a starting point for discussions of how human balance is maintained during standing and locomotion. Here we examine three experimental paradigms of time-delayed balance control: (1) mechanical inverted time-delayed pendulum, (2) stick balancing at the fingertip, and (3) human postural sway during quiet standing. Measurements of the transfer function (mechanical stick balancing) and the two-point correlation function (Hurst exponent) for the movements of the fingertip (real stick balancing) and the fluctuations in the center of pressure (postural sway) demonstrate that the upright fixed point is unstable in all three paradigms. These observations imply that the balanced state represents a more complex and bounded time-dependent state than a fixed-point attractor. Although mathematical models indicate that a sufficient condition for instability is for the time delay to make a corrective movement, tau(n), be greater than a critical delay tau(c) that is proportional to the length of the pendulum, this condition is satisfied only in the case of human stick balancing at the fingertip. Thus it is suggested that a common cause of instability in all three paradigms stems from the difficulty of controlling both the angle of the inverted pendulum and the position of the controller simultaneously using time-delayed feedback. Considerations of the problematic nature of control in the presence of delay and random perturbations ("noise") suggest that neural control for the upright position likely resembles an adaptive-type controller in which the displacement angle is allowed to drift for small displacements with active corrections made only when theta exceeds a threshold. This mechanism draws attention to an overlooked type of passive control that arises from the interplay between retarded variables and noise.},

Interspike interval histograms were used to estimate the interval death rate, which is a measure of the instantaneous probability of spike occurrence as a function of the time since the: preceding spike. It had been previously proposed that tart: death rate can be used to estimate the AHP trajectory We tested the accuracy of this estimate by comparing the AHP trajectory predicted from discharge statistics to the measured AHP trajectory of the motoneurone. 2. The discharge statistics of noise-driven cat motoneurones shared a number of features with those previously reported for voluntarily activated human motoneurones. At lon discharge rates, the interspike interval histograms were often positively skewed with an exponential tail. Title standard deviation of the interspike intervals increased with the mean interval, and the plots of standard deviation versus the mean interspike interval generally showed an upward I,end, the onset of which was related to the motoneurone's AHP duration. 3. The AHP trajectories predicted from the interval death rates were generally smaller in amplitude (i.e. less hyperpolarized) than the measured AHP trajectories. This discrepancy may result from the fact that spike threshold varies during the interspike interval, so that the distance to threshold at a given time depends upon both the membrane trajectory and the spike threshold trajectory Nonetheless, since the interval death rate is likely to reflect the instantaneous distance to threshold during the interspike interval, it provides a functionally relevant measure of fluctuations in motoneurone excitability during repetitive discharge.},

abstract = {It was the aim of the present paper to investigate the influence of otolith disorders on human postural control by different methods. The 33 patients of our study had undergone a minor head injury and suffered subsequently from an utricular or sacculo-utricular disorder as evidenced by vestibular evoked myogenic potential recordings and eccentric rotation recordings of the otolith-ocular responses. Postural control was assessed by performing stance/gait tests (standard balance deficit test, SBDT) and by evaluating trunk sway (using angular velocity sensors). Moreover, classical tests of the posterior column of the spinal tract (Romberg/Unterberger) and the dynamic posturography (sensory organization test, SOT) were included. It could be shown that SBDT tasks with reduced proprioceptive and visual cues (e.g. standing on foam, eyes closed) are most sensitive for an otolith disorder. The patients showed an increased trunk sway in the pitch plane (i.e. linear motion as adequate utricular stimulus) and an increase in sway velocities (i.e. tilting movements as adequate saccular stimulus) compared to controls. The SOT was most sensitive for combined (sacculo-utricular) otolith disorders (78{\%}) while vestibulospinal tests are not enough sensitive. In essence, otolith disorders evidently impair human postural control and have been possibly underestimated as a source of posttraumatic postural imbalance as yet.},

abstract = {Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is commonly considered a prototype of a hereditary demyelinating polyneuropathy. Apart from the myelin involvement, there has been little information on axonal membrane properties in this condition. Taking advantage of the uniform nature of the disease process, we undertook the in vivo assessment of multiple axonal excitability properties at the median nerve in nine CMT1A patients with PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein 22) gene duplication and 53 controls. The thresholds of CMT1A patients were much higher than normal, and threshold electrotonus (TE) exhibited a consistent pattern of abnormalities: early steep changes (fanning out) of both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses were followed by increased inward rectification to hyperpolarizing currents and unusually fast accommodation to depolarizing currents. Strength-duration time constants and the shapes of recovery cycles were normal, although refractoriness and superexcitability were reduced relative to controls. The high thresholds and early fanning out of electrotonus indicated altered cable properties, such that a greater proportion than normal of applied currents reached internodal rather than nodal axolemma. The rapid accommodation to depolarizing currents suggested activation of fast K+ channels, which are normally sequestered from the nodal membrane. The excitability abnormalities are therefore consistent with a demyelinating pathology and exposure or spread of K+ channels from under the myelin. It remains to be seen whether the TE abnormalities in CMT1A, which resemble previous recordings from normal immature rats, can be distinguished from those in acquired demyelinating neuropathies.},

This article selectively reviews psychophysical and computational studies of streaming and comprehensively reviews more recent neurophysiological studies that have provided important insights into the mechanisms of streaming. On the basis of these studies, segregation of sounds is likely to occur beginning in the auditory periphery and continuing at least to primary auditory cortex for simple cues such as pure-tone frequency but at stages as high as secondary auditory cortex for more complex cues such as periodicity pitch. Attention-dependent and perception-dependent processes are likely to take place in primary or secondary auditory cortex and may also involve higher level areas outside of auditory cortex. Topographic maps of acoustic attributes, stimulus-specific suppression, and competition between representations are among the neurophysiological mechanisms that likely contribute to streaming.

abstract = {A least-squares approach to computing inverse dynamics is proposed. The method utilizes equations of motion for a multi-segment body incorporating terms for ground reaction forces and torques. The resulting system is overdetermined at each point in time, because kinematic and force measurements outnumber unknown torques, and may be solved using weighted least squares to yield estimates of the joint torques and joint angular accelerations that best match measured data. An error analysis makes it possible to predict error magnitudes for bath conventional and least-squares methods. A modification of the method also makes it possible to reject constant biases such as those arising from misalignment of force plate and kinematic measurement reference frames. A benchmark case is presented, which demonstrates reductions in joint torque errors on the order of 30 percent compared to the conventional Newton-Euler method for a wide range of noise levels on measured data. The advantages over the Newton-Euler method include making best Else of all available measurements, ability to function when less than a full complement of ground reaction forces is measured, suppression of residual torques acting on the rep-most body segment, and the rejection of constant biases in data.},

abstract = {During normal daily activity, muscle motor units (MUs) develop unfused tetanic contractions evoked by trains of motoneuronal firings at variable interpulse intervals (IPIs). The mechanical responses of a MU to successive impulses are not identical. The aim of this study was to develop a mathematical approach for the prediction of each response within the tetanus as well as the tetanic force itself. Experimental unfused tetani of fast and slow rat MUs, evoked by trains of stimuli at variable IPIs, were decomposed into series of twitch-shaped responses to successive stimuli using a previously described algorithm. The relationships between the parameters of the modeled twitches and the tetanic force level at which the next response begins were examined and regression equations were derived. Using these equations, profiles of force for the same and different stimulation patterns were mathematically predicted by summating modeled twitches. For comparison, force predictions were made by the summation of twitches equal to the first one. The recorded and the predicted tetanic forces were compared. The results revealed that it is possible to predict tetanic force with high accuracy by using regression equations. The force predicted in this way was much closer to the experimental record than the force obtained by the summation of equal twitches, especially for slow MUs. These findings are likely to have an impact on the development of realistic muscle models composed of MUs, and will assist our understanding of the significance of the neuronal code in motor control and the role of biophysical processes during MU contractions.

abstract = {Our intent in this review was to consider the relationship between the biophysical properties of motoneurons and the mechanisms by which they transduce the synaptic inputs they receive into changes in their firing rates. Our emphasis has been on experimental results obtained over the past twenty years, which have shown that motoneurons are just as complex and interesting as other central neurons. This work has shown that motoneurons are endowed with a rich complement of active dendritic conductances, and flexible control of both somatic and dendritic channels by endogenous neuromodulators. Although this new information requires some revision of the simple view of motoneuron input-output properties that was prevalent in the early 1980's (see sections 2.3 and 2.10), the basic aspects of synaptic transduction by motoneurons can still be captured by a relatively simple input-output model (see section 2.3, equations 1-3). It remains valid to describe motoneuron recruitment as a product of the total synaptic current delivered to the soma, the effective input resistance of the motoneuron and the somatic voltage threshold for spike initiation (equations 1 and 2). However, because of the presence of active channels activated in the subthreshold range, both the delivery of synaptic current and the effective input resistance depend upon membrane potential. In addition, activation of metabotropic receptors by achetylcholine, glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin, substance P and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH) can alter the properties of various voltage- and calcium-sensitive channels and thereby affect synaptic current delivery and input resistance. Once motoneurons are activated, their steady-state rate of repetitive discharge is linearly related to the amount of injected or synaptic current reaching the soma (equation 3). However, the slope of this relation, the minimum discharge rate and the threshold current for repetitive discharge are all subject to neuromodulatory control. There are still a number of unresolved issues concerning the control of motoneuron discharge by synaptic inputs. Under dynamic conditions, when synaptic input is rapidly changing, time- and activity-dependent changes in the state of ionic channels will alter both synaptic current delivery to the spike-generating conductances and the relation between synaptic current and discharge rate. There is at present no general quantitative expression for motoneuron input-output properties under dynamic conditions. Even under steady-state conditions, the biophysical mechanisms underlying the transfer of synaptic current from the dendrites to the soma are not well understood, due to the paucity of direct recordings from motoneuron dendrites. It seems likely that resolving these important issues will keep motoneuron afficiandoes well occupied during the next twenty years.},

abstract = {Estimation of individual muscle forces during human movement can provide insight into neural control and tissue loading and call thus contribute to improved diagnosis and management of both neurological and orthopaedic conditions. Direct measurement of muscle forces is generally not feasible in a clinical setting, and non-invasive methods based on musculoskeletal modeling should therefore be considered. The current state of the art in clinical movement analysis is that resultant joint torques can be reliably estimated from motion data and external forces (inverse dynamic analysis). Static optimization methods to transform joint torques into estimates of individual muscle forces using musculoskeletal models, have been known for several decades. To date however, none of these methods have been successfully translated into clinical practice. The main obstacles are the lack of studies reporting successful validation of muscle force estimates, and the lack of user-friendly and efficient computer software. Recent advances in forward dynamics methods have opened up new opportunities. Forward dynamic optimization can be performed such that solutions are less dependent on measured kinematics and ground reaction forces, and are consistent with additional knowledge, such as the force-length-velocity-activation relationships of the muscles, and with observed electromyography signals during movement. We conclude that clinical applications of current research should be encouraged, supported by further development of computational tools and research into new algorithms for muscle force estimation and their validation.

In Asia and Central and South America, it is the major subtype of GBS, seen in 30-65{\{}{\%}{\}} of patients. AMAN progresses more rapidly and has an earlier peak than demyelinating GBS; tendon reflexes are relatively preserved or even exaggerated, and autonomic dysfunction is rare. One of the main causes is molecular mimicry of human gangliosides by Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides. In addition to axonal degeneration, electrophysiology shows rapidly reversible nerve conduction blockade or slowing, presumably due to pathological changes at the nodes or paranodes. Autoantibodies that bind to GM1 or GD1a gangliosides at the nodes of Ranvier activate complement and disrupt sodium-channel clusters and axoglial junctions, which leads to nerve conduction failure and muscle weakness. Improved understanding of the disease mechanism and pathophysiology might lead to new treatment options and improve the outlook for patients with AMAN. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Dynamic joint stiffness defines the dynamic relationship between the position of a joint and the torque acting about it and can be separated into intrinsic and reflex components. Under stationary conditions, these can be identified using a nonlinear parallel-cascade algorithm that models intrinsic stiffness-a linear dynamic response to position-and reflex stiffness-a nonlinear dynamic response to velocity-as parallel pathways. Experiments using this method show that both intrinsic and reflex stiffness depend strongly on the operating point, defined by position and torque, likely because of some underlying nonlinear behavior not modeled by the parallel-cascade structure. Consequently, both intrinsic and reflex stiffness will appear to be time-varying whenever the operating point changes rapidly, as during movement. This paper describes and validates an extension of the parallel-cascade algorithm to time-varying conditions. It describes the ensemble method used to estimate time-varying intrinsic and reflex stiffness. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can track rapid changes in joint stiffness accurately. Finally, the performance of the algorithm in the presence of noise is tested. We conclude that the new algorithm is a powerful new tool for the study of joint stiffness during functional tasks.},

abstract = {Motoneurons receive synaptic inputs from tens of thousands of connections that cause membrane potential to fluctuate continuously (synaptic noise), which introduces variability in discharge times of action potentials. We hypothesized that the influence of synaptic noise on force steadiness during voluntary contractions is limited to low muscle forces. The hypothesis was examined with an analytical description of transduction of motor unit spike trains into muscle force, a computational model of motor unit recruitment and rate coding, and experimental analysis of interspike interval variability during steady contractions with the abductor digiti minimi muscle. Simulations varied contraction force, level of synaptic noise, size of motor unit population, recruitment range, twitch contraction times, and level of motor unit short-term synchronization. Consistent with the analytical derivations, simulations and experimental data showed that force variability at target forces above a threshold was primarily due to low-frequency oscillations in neural drive, whereas the influence of synaptic noise was almost completely attenuated by two low-pass filters, one related to convolution of motoneuron spike trains with motor unit twitches (temporal summation) and the other attributable to summation of single motor unit forces (spatial summation). The threshold force above which synaptic noise ceased to influence force steadiness depended on recruitment range, size of motor unit population, and muscle contractile properties. This threshold was low (<10{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximal force) for typical values of these parameters. Results indicate that motor unit recruitment and muscle properties of a typical muscle are tuned to limit the influence of synaptic noise on force steadiness to low forces and that the inability to produce a constant force during stronger contractions is mainly attributable to the common low-frequency oscillations in motoneuron discharge rates.},

abstract = {An allometric analysis of the number of muscle spindles in relation to muscle mass in mammalian (mouse, rat, guinea-pig, cat, human) skeletal muscles is presented. It is shown that the trend to increasing number as muscle mass increases follows an isometric (length) relationship between species, whereas within a species, at least for the only essentially complete sample (human), the number of spindles scales, on average, with the square root rather than the cube root of muscle mass. An attempt is made to reconcile these apparently discrepant relationships. Use of the widely accepted spindle density (number of spindles g(-1) of muscle) as a measure of relative abundance of spindles in different muscles is shown to be grossly misleading. It is replaced with the residuals of the linear regression of ln spindle number against ln muscle mass. Significant differences in relative spindle abundance as measured by residuals were found between regional groups of muscles: the greatest abundance is in axial muscles, including those concerned with head position, whereas the least is in muscles of the shoulder girdle. No differences were found between large and small muscles operating in parallel, or between antigravity and non-antigravity muscles. For proximal vs. distal muscles, spindles were significantly less abundant in the hand than the arm, but there was no difference between the foot and the leg.},

abstract = {A major presenting symptom in ‘individuals with multiple sclerosis with mild balance disability’ (IwMS) is poor postural control, resulting from slowed spinal somatosensory conduction. Postural control deficits in IwMS are most apparent when vision is removed and the base of support is reduced such is the case during tandem and single support stances. The current study used center of pressure (COP) measurements to determine whether postural control differences exist between IwMS and either ‘healthy age-matched individuals’ (HAMI) or ‘community-dwelling older adults’ (OA). Postural control was evaluated using a Romberg standing task, which required participants to stand with their feet together and hands by their sides for 45 s with either their eyes open or closed. Results revealed that COP velocity root mean square was greater in IwMS and their COP position was closer to their self-selected maximum stability limits (e.g., greater Standing Index proportion) when vision was removed compared to HAMI. Conversely, IwMS displayed similar postural control characteristics to OA. The current study highlights two novel findings: (1) the utility of novel COP measurements to assess differences in the level of postural control in IwMS; and (2) the benefit of assessing postural control levels in IwMS to not only a population with a fully intact and functional postural control system (HAMI) but also to another population that is thought to experience postural control deficits (OA).},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that plantar cutaneous afferents can adjust motoneuron excitability, which may contribute significantly to the control of human posture and locomotion. However, the role of plantar cutaneous afferents in modulating the excitability of stretch and H-reflex with respect to the location of their excitation remains unclear. In the present study, it was hypothesized that electrical stimulation delivered to the sole of the foot might be followed by modulation of spinal excitability that depends on: (1) the stimulation location and (2) the reflex studied. In these experiments, conditioned and unconditioned stretch and H-reflexes were evoked in 16 healthy subjects in a seated position. Both reflexes were conditioned by non-noxious electrical plantar cutaneous afferent stimulation at two different sites, the heel and metatarsal regions, at four different conditioning-test (CT) intervals. The conditioning stimulation delivered to the heel caused a significant facilitation of the soleus stretch reflex for all CT intervals, whereas the soleus H-reflex had significant facilitation only at CT interval of 50 ms and significant inhibition at longer CT intervals. Stimulation delivered to the metatarsal region, however, resulted mainly in reduced stretch and H-reflex sizes. This study extends the reported findings on the contribution of plantar cutaneous afferents within spinal interneuron reflex circuits as a function of their location and the reflex studied.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alpha motoneurons receive common synaptic inputs from spinal and supraspinal pathways. As a result, a certain degree of correlation can be observed between motoneuron spike trains during voluntary contractions. This has been studied by using correlation measures in the time and frequency domains. These measures are interpreted as reflecting different types of connectivity in the spinal networks, although the relation between the degree of correlation of the output motoneuron spike trains and of their synaptic inputs is unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we analyze theoretically this relation and we complete this analysis by simulations and experimental data on the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The results demonstrate that correlation measures between motoneuron output spike trains are inherently influenced by the discharge rate and that this influence cannot be compensated by normalization. Because of the influence of discharge rate, frequency domain measures of correlation (coherence) do not identify the full frequency content of the common input signal when computed from pairs of motoneurons. Rather, an increase in sampling rate is needed by using cumulative spike trains of several motoneurons. Moreover, the application of averaging filters to the spike trains influences the magnitude of the estimated correlation levels calculated in the time, but not in the frequency domain (coherence). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the analysis of coherence in different frequency bands between cumulative spike trains of a sufficient number of motoneurons provides information on the spectrum of the common synaptic input. Nonetheless, the absolute values of coherent peaks cannot be compared across conditions with different cumulative discharge rates.},

abstract = {We used the framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis to analyze the structure of finger force variability in discrete (ramp) and oscillatory force production tasks performed by the index and middle fingers of the right hand acting in parallel. Subjects performed the tasks at fast and slow rates, with and without a visual template presented on the screen. The variance of finger forces was partitioned into two components, compensated variance (V-COMP), which did not affect total force, and uncompensated variance (V-UN), which affected total force. Only minor effects of task (discrete or oscillatory) and of template (with or without) were seen on the variance profiles, leading us to conclude that the basic principles of synergy organization are common across discrete and oscillatory tasks. In contrast, the rate of force production had major effects on the structure of force variance. A modification of Goodman's model of motor variability was used to analyze the dependences V-UN and V-COMP on the magnitude of force and on the rate of force production. VUN showed a strong relation to the rate of force production and only weak dependence on the magnitude of force. In contrast, VcoMP showed minimal effects of the rate of force production and strong effects of the force magnitude. The findings are interpreted as demonstrations of a limitation in the ability of the central nervous system to organize a two-finger synergy such that errors in the timing of individual finger force profiles are canceling each other's effects on the total force. In contrast, the synergy is efficiently intercompensating errors related to imprecise setting of force magnitudes of the two fingers.},

abstract = {Neurons send signals to each other by means of sequences of action potentials (spikes). Ignoring variations in spike amplitude and shape that are probably not meaningful to a receiving cell, the information content, or entropy of the signal depends on only the timing of action potentials, and because there is no external clock, only the interspike intervals, and not the absolute spike times, are significant. Estimating spike train entropy is a difficult task, particularly with small data sets, and many methods of entropy estimation have been proposed. Here we present two related model-based methods for estimating the entropy of neural signals and compare them to existing methods. One of the methods is fast and reasonably accurate, and it converges well with short spike time records; the other is impractically time-consuming but apparently very accurate, relying on generating artificial data that are a statistical match to the experimental data. Using the slow, accurate method to generate a best-estimate entropy value, we find that the faster estimator converges to this value more closely and with smaller data sets than many existing entropy estimators.},

For better understanding of these phenomena, we built an activation model with emphasis on the calcium liberation from and re-sequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, including calcium-induced calcium release. The model had two stable equilibrium points in the calcium concentration. Changes from the low to the high equilibrium point could be produced by high-frequency trains of pulses and would account for the potentiation. The model also showed a catch-like effect, as a long-lasting increment of muscle force after the application of a single extra pulse. The increase in force appeared in resting muscle, disappeared when the muscle was potentiated, and reappeared briefly if the stimulation was continued for long periods.},

We have conducted a series of studies examining the single unit activity of these neurons in behaving cats. The experiments were directed at determining whether changes in unit activity were related to pain (n. raphe magnus), autonomic activity (n. raphe obscurus and pallidus), or motor activity (n. raphe obscurus and pallidus). The strongest relationship was between neuronal activity and motor output, especially tonic and repetitive motor activity. We hypothesize that the primary functions of this motor-related activity are to facilitate motor output, suppress processing of some forms of afferent activity, and to coordinate autonomic functioning with the current motor demand.},

abstract = {Reweighting sensory information adaptively is considered critical for flexible postural control, but little is known of the time scale of the reweighting process. We analyzed the transient dynamics of sensory reweighting in a previously published nonlinear adaptive model of sensory integration in the human postural control system. The model's dynamics of adaptation were tested in response to abrupt changes in the amplitude of the motion of the visual surround. In addition to qualitatively reproducing the correct asymptotic response to such changes in visual amplitude, as previously found, the model qualitatively reproduced the asymmetric transient response elucidated in recent experiments (Oie et al. in Gait Posture 2005). In particular, the model adapts at an initially rapid rate to a switch from low to high amplitude visual motion, but at an initially slower rate upon the return to low amplitude motion. The observed temporal asymmetry has potential functional value. Rapid downweighting of a visual stimulus that suddenly increases is necessary to prevent loss of upright equilibrium. A visual stimulus that decreases in amplitude does not pose a threat to upright balance, allowing for slower upweighting without functional consequence.},

abstract = {Motoneurons have extensive dendritic trees that receive the numerous inputs required to produce movement. These dendrites are highly active, containing voltage-sensitive channels that generate persistent inward currents (PICs) that can enhance synaptic input 5-fold or more. However, this enhancement is proportional to the level of activity of monoaminergic inputs from the brainstem that release serotonin and noradrenalin. The higher this activity, the larger the dendritic PIC and the higher the firing rate evoked by a given amount of excitatory synaptic input. This brainstem control of motoneuron input-output gain translates directly into control of system gain of a motor pool and its muscle. Because large dendritic PICs are probably necessary for motoneurons to have sufficient gain to generate large forces, it is possible that descending monoaminergic inputs scale in proportion to voluntary force. Inhibition from sensory inputs has a strong suppressive effect on dendritic PICs: the stronger the inhibition, the smaller the PIC. Thus, local inhibitory inputs within the cord may oppose the descending monoaminergic control of PICs. Most motor behaviors evoke a mixture of excitation and inhibition (e.g., the reciprocal inhibition between antagonists). Therefore, normal joint movements may involve constant adjustment of PIC amplitude.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occurrence of residual neuropathy and its self-reported health consequences in a population-based group of patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS) and to characterize quantitatively the concomitant motor, sensory, and autonomic impairments. METHODS: Forty patients (mean age 46 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of GBS were studied a mean of 7 years (range 1 to 13 years) after the acute attack together with 40 healthy control subjects. The Dyck minimal criteria of neuropathy, the Neuropathy Symptom Score, the Neuropathy Disability Score, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) generic health questionnaire, isokinetic dynamometry at ankle and wrist, quantitative sensory testing of thresholds for vibration, cold, and pain, autonomic function tests, nerve conduction studies, and a summed Neuropathy Rank Sum Score (NRSS) were applied. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (48{\%}) had residual neuropathy, which was independent of follow-up time. The patients with GBS reported lower health status than control subjects on the SF-36 Physical Component Summary Scale (PCS; p = 0.01), and the PCS scores correlated with the NRSS (r = -0.41, p = 0.009). In patients with GBS, muscle strength at ankle dorsal flexion was reduced by 13.9{\%} (p = 0.001), sensory thresholds for vibration were increased in the foot (p < 0.05), and sensory thresholds for cold were increased in the hand and foot (p < 0.05), whereas autonomic functions and pain thresholds were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Residual neuropathy affecting large- and medium-sized myelinated fibers endures long after the acute attack of Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome in approximately half of all patients, leads to motor and sensory dysfunction, and shows a trend toward impairing self-reported physical health status.},

abstract = {The goal of the study was to investigate the influence of asymmetric coupling, between the soma and dendrites, on the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of a two-compartment model. We used a recently published method for generating reduced two-compartment models that retain the asymmetric coupling of anatomically reconstructed motor neurons. The passive input-output relationship of the asymmetrically coupled model was analytically compared to the symmetrically coupled case. Predictions based on the analytic comparison were tested using numerical simulations. The simulations evaluated the nonlinear dynamics of the models as a function of coupling parameters. Analytical results showed that the input resistance at the dendrite of the asymmetric model was directly related to the degree of coupling asymmetry. In contrast, a comparable symmetric model had identical input resistances at both the soma and dendrite regardless of coupling strength. These findings lead to predictions that variations in dendritic excitability, subsequent to changes in input resistance, might change the current threshold and onset timing of the plateau potential generated in the dendrite. Since the plateau potential underlies bistable firing, these results further predicted that asymmetric coupling might alter nonlinear (i.e. bistable) firing patterns. The numerical simulations supported analytical predictions, showing that the fully bistable firing pattern of the asymmetric model depended on the degree of coupling asymmetry and its correlated dendritic excitability. The physiological property of asymmetric coupling plays an important role in generating and stabilizing the bistability of motor neurons by interacting with the excitability of dendritic branches.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify the influence of intrinsic properties, active dendritic conductances, and background excitation and inhibition on measures of discharge correlation in the time and frequency domains with known levels and patterns of common synaptic input. The study involved a computer simulation of a population of neurons with a range of input resistances (0.54-3.7 MOmega) and surface areas (407,000-712,000 microm(2)). The neurons were simulated with no, moderate, or high levels of active dendritic conductances and were activated with either excitatory input only or excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The patterns of common input, either branched common input or common modulation, were tested with 0, 30, 60, and 90{\{}{\%}{\}} common input. The results confirm previous findings of an exponential relation between the level of common input and indexes of synchronization; only when the common input comprised >/=60{\{}{\%}{\}} of the total excitatory input was there a significant effect on discharge correlation. Synchronization was greatest in models that had passive dendrites. Active dendritic conductances caused the discharge rate of the neuron to saturate and decreased motor-unit synchronization. However, the addition of 10{\{}{\%}{\}} background inhibitory input increased synchronization in these models. In contrast, common rhythmic modulation of inputs at 24 Hz usually decreased synchronization. Significant coherence at the modulated frequency occurred in the commonly modulated neurons when >/=60{\{}{\%}{\}} of the inputs were modulated. Furthermore, active dendritic conductances decreased coherence. Branched common input caused high levels of coherence across a broad spectrum and when combined with active dendritic conductances caused significant frequency peaks in the 30- to 50-Hz band. In conclusion, the level of inhibitory input and active dendritic conductances interact with the amount of common input to determine time- and frequency-domain discharge correlation.},

abstract = {The ability of inhibitory synaptic inputs to dampen the excitability of motoneurons is augmented when persistent inward currents (PICs) are activated. This amplification could be due to an increase in the driving potential of inhibitory synapses or the deactivation of the channels underlying PICs. Our goal was to determine which mechanism leads to the amplification of inhibitory inputs by PICs. To reach this goal, we measured inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in decerebrate cats during somatic voltage-clamp steps. These IPSCs were generated by tonic activation of Renshaw cells. The IPSCs exhibited a rapid rise and a slower decay to a plateau level. Activation of PICs always led to an increase in the peak of the IPSC, but the amount of decay after the peak of the IPSC was inversely related to the size of the IPSC. These results were replicated in simulations based on compartmental models of motoneurons incorporating distributions of Renshaw cell synapses based on anatomical observations, and L-type calcium channels distributed as 100-mu m-long hot spots centered 100 to 400 mu m away from the soma. For smaller IPSCs, amplification by PICs was due to an increase in the driving force of the inhibitory synaptic current. For larger IPSCs, amplification was caused by deactivation of the channels underlying PICs leading to a lesser decay of the IPSCs. As a result of this change in the time course of the IPSC, deactivation of the channels underlying PICs leads to a greater amplification of the total inhibitory synaptic current.},

abstract = {Male rat motoneurons innervating the pubococcygeus muscle were located in the ventral nucleus of lamina IX at the sixth lumbar (L6) and first sacral (S1) spinal cord segments. Retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin was transported up to second-order dendrites and revealed that these motoneurons have a "U-shaped arborization" of dendrites toward the intermediolateral and intermediomedial nuclei area of lamina VII. This dendritic organization makes a wide "final common path" that probably integrates afferent information from several sources! accounting for the participation of the pubococcygeus muscle in autonomic and somatic processes, such as those related to micturition and reproduction. Castration produced a decrement in the morphometry of these motoneurons. A main effect was a decrement in dendritic length. Steroid replacement indicated that testosterone and estradiol, but not dihydrotestosterone, are able to induce a recovery of morphometric alterations. However, estrogen induced recovery after 2 weeks of treatment, whereas testosterone took 4 weeks. Thus, it is proposed that supraspinal aromatization of testosterone in the male central nervous system might be an important process for the appropriate organization of the pubococcygeus muscle motoneurons and that estradiol seems to need a shorter time of action than testosterone because of differential up-regulation and down-regulation of steroid receptors.

abstract = {Background: Extrafusal muscle fibers of human striated skeletal muscles are known to have a uniform innervation pattern. Motor endplates (MEP) of the ''en plaque'' type are located near the center of muscle fibers and distributed within the muscles in a narrow band. The aim of this study was to evaluate the innervation pattern of human facial muscles and compare it with that of skeletal muscles. Methods: Ten facial muscles from 11 human cadavers were dissected, the nerve entrance points located, and the dimensions measured, All muscles were stained in tote for MEPs using Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and examined under the microscope to determine their location, Single muscle fibers were teased to evaluate the stained MEPs, Results: The length of the different facial muscles varied from 29 to 65 mm, which correlated to the length of the corresponding muscle fibers, MEP zones were found on the muscles in the immediate vicinity of the nerves' entrance points and located eccentrically. Numbers and locations varied from muscle to muscle. Three MEP zone distribution patterns were differentiated: numerous small MEP zones were evenly spread over the muscle, a predominant MEP zone and two to three small zones were spread at random, and two to four MEP zones of equal size were randomly scattered. One MEP of the ''en plaque'' type was found in 73.8{\%} of the muscle fibers and two to five MEPs were found in 26.2{\%}. The distances between the multiple MEPs on one muscle fiber varied from 10 to 500 mu m. Conclusions: This study suggests that facial muscles differ from skeletal muscles regarding distribution and number of MEPs. The eccentric location of MEP zones and multiple MEPs suggests there is an independent mechanism of neural regulation in the facial muscle system. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Since the first experimental evidences of active conductances in dendrites, most neurons have been shown to exhibit dendritic excitability through the expression of a variety of voltage-gated ion channels. However, despite experimental and theoretical efforts undertaken in the past decades, the role of this excitability for some kind of dendritic computation has remained elusive. Here we show that, owing to very general properties of excitable media, the average output of a model of an active dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of its afferent rate, attaining extremely large dynamic ranges (above 50 dB). Moreover, the model yields double-sigmoid response functions as experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. We claim that enhancement of dynamic range is the primary functional role of active dendritic conductances. We predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic range and that blocking of active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range.},

abstract = {Populations of neurons in the retina, olfactory system, visual and somatosensory thalamus, and several cortical regions show temporal correlation between the discharge times of their action potentials (spike trains). Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding, attention, stimulus discrimination, and motor behaviour. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood, and its coding implications are still debated. It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate-and-fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold-linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result. This connection between the rate and correlation of spiking activity links two fundamental features of the neural code.},

abstract = {Voluntary movement is accompanied by changes in the degree to which neurons in the brain synchronize their activity within discrete frequency ranges. Two patterns of movement-related oscillatory activity stand out in human cortical motor areas. Activity in the beta frequency (15-30 Hz) band is prominent during tonic contractions but is attenuated prior to and during voluntary movement. Without such attenuation, movement may be slowed, leading to the suggestion that beta activity promotes postural and tonic contraction, possibly at a cost to the generation of new movements. In contrast, activity in the gamma (60-90 Hz) band increases during movement. The direction of change suggests that gamma activity might facilitate motor processing. In correspondence with this, increased frontal gamma activity is related with reduced reaction times. Yet the possibility remains that these functional correlations reflect an epiphenomenal rather than causal relationship. Here we provide strong evidence that oscillatory activities at the cortical level are mechanistically involved in determining motor behavior and can even improve performance. By driving cortical oscillations using noninvasive electrical stimulation, we show opposing effects at beta and gamma frequencies and interactions with motor task that reveal the potential quantitative importance of oscillations in motor behavior.},

@article{DeLuca2014,
abstract = {Muscles are composed of groups of muscle fibers, called motor units, each innervated by a single motoneuron originating in the spinal cord. During constant or linearly varying voluntary force contractions, motor units are activated in a hierarchical order, with the earlier-recruited motor units having greater firing rates than the later-recruited ones. We found that this normal pattern of firing activation can be altered during oscillatory contractions where the force oscillates at frequencies ≥2 Hz. During these high-frequency oscillations, the activation of the lower-threshold motor units effectively decreases and that of the higher-threshold motor units effectively increases. This transposition of firing activation provides means to activate higher-threshold motor units preferentially. Our results demonstrate that the hierarchical regulation of motor unit activation can be manipulated to activate specific motoneuron populations preferentially. This finding can be exploited to develop new forms of physical therapies and exercise programs that enhance muscle performance or that target the preferential atrophy of high-threshold motor units as a result of aging or motor disorders such as stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

@article{Fagergren2003,
abstract = {When picking up a familiar object between the index finger and the thumb, the motor commands are predetermined by the CNS to correspond to the frictional demand of the finger-object contact area. If the friction is less than expected, the object will start to slip out of the hand, giving rise to unexpected sensory information. Here we study the correction strategies of the motor system in response to an unexpected frictional demand. The motor commands to the mononeuron pool are estimated by a novel technique combining behavioral recordings and neuromuscular modelling. We first propose a mathematical model incorporating muscles, hand mechanics, and the action of lifting an object. A simple control system sends motor commands to and receives sensory signals from the model. We identify three factors influencing the efficiency of the correction: the time development of the motor command, the delay between the onset of the grip and load forces (GF-LF-delay), and how fast the lift is performed. A sensitivity analysis describes how these factors affect the ability to prevent or stop slipping and suggests an efficient control strategy that prepares and corrects for an altered frictional condition. We then analyzed fingertip grip and load forces (GF and LF) and position data from 200 lifts made by five healthy subjects. The friction was occasionally reduced, forcing an increase of the GF to prevent the object being dropped. The data were then analyzed by feeding it through the inverted model. This provided an estimate of the motor commands to the motoneuron pool. As suggested by the sensitivity analysis the GF-LF-delay was indeed used by the subjects to prevent slip. In agreement with recordings from neurons in the primary motor cortex of the monkey, a sharp burst in the estimated GF motor command (NGF) efficiently arrested any slip. The estimated motor commands indicate a control system that uses a small set of corrective commands, which together with the GF-LF-delay form efficient correction strategies. The selection of a strategy depends on the amount of tactile information reporting unexpected friction and how long it takes to arrive. We believe that this technique of estimating the motor commands behind the fingertip forces during a precision grip lift can provide a powerful tool for the investigation of the central control of the motor system.},

However, clinical and postmortem observations, as well as genetic studies, demonstrate that there is considerable variability in the phenotypic expression of ALS. Here, we review the phenotypic variability of ALS and how it is reflected in familial and sporadic ALS, in the degree of upper and lower motor neuron involvement, in motor and extramotor involvement, and in the spectrum of ALS and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, we discuss some unusual clinical characteristics regarding presentation, age at onset and disease progression. Finally, we address the importance of this variability for understanding the pathogenesis of ALS and for the development of therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Severe muscle atrophy occurs after complete denervation. Here, Embryonic Day 14-15 ventral spinal cord cells were transplanted into the distal tibial nerve stump of adult female Fischer rats to provide a source of neurons for muscle reinnervation. Our aim was to characterize the properties of the reinnervated motor units and muscle fibers. Some reinnervated motor units contracted spontaneously. Electrical stimulation of the transplants at increasing intensity produced an average (+/- SE) of 7 +/- 1 electromyographic and force steps. Each signal increment represented the excitation of another motor unit. These reinnervated units exerted an average force of 12.0 +/- 1.5 mN, strength similar to that of control fatigue-resistant units. Repeated transplant stimulation depleted 17{\%} of the muscle fibers of glycogen, an indication of some functional reinnervation. Reinnervated (glycogen-depleted), denervated (no cells transplanted), and control fibers were of histochemical type I, IIA, or IIB. Fibers of the same type were grouped after reinnervation. The proportion of fiber types also changed. Reinnervated fibers were primarily type IIA, whereas most fibers in denervated and control muscles were type IIB. Reinnervated fibers of each type had significantly larger cross-sectional areas than the corresponding fiber types in denervated muscles. These data suggest that neurons with different properties can reside in the unusual environment of the adult rat peripheral nerve, make functional connections with muscle, specify muscle fiber type, and reduce the amount that each type atrophies.

It has been asserted that this is because there is a high density of Na(+) channels in the AIS. However, we found that action potential-associated Na(+) flux, as measured by high-speed fluorescence Na(+) imaging, was about threefold larger in the rat AIS than in the soma. Spike-evoked Na(+) flux in the AIS and the first node of Ranvier was similar and was eightfold lower in basal dendrites. At near-threshold voltages, persistent Na(+) conductance was almost entirely axonal. On a time scale of seconds, passive diffusion, and not pumping, was responsible for maintaining transmembrane Na(+) gradients in thin axons during high-frequency action potential firing. In computer simulations, these data were consistent with the known features of action potential generation in these neurons.},

abstract = {The results of recent studies designed to reveal some of the 'rules' governing the integration of synaptic and intrinsic dendritic currents in spinal motoneurons are reviewed. When two or more sources of synaptic input are activated concurrently, their combined postsynaptic effects on cat spinal motoneurons with 'passive dendrites' are generally equal to or slightly less than those predicted from the linear sum of their individual effects. However, for experimental preparations in which active conductances on motoneuron dendrites are enabled, instances of greater-than- or less-than linear summation can occur. Further, these studies demonstrate that the persistent inward currents that are generated by motoneuron dendrites provide an intrinsic source of excitatory drive that is larger than those associated with any of the individual synaptic input systems studied to date. Since these intrinsic depolarizing currents can be rapidly inactivated by a hyperpolarizing input, they are ideally suited to providing a major source of the alternating 'drive' to motoneurons during locomotion.},

The calyx of Held is a giant synapse located in the brainstem which is widely used for experimental recording of neurotransmitter release. We focus on the study of the exocytotic dynamics for a pool of readily releasable vesicles using a Monte Carlo simulation scheme that includes models for the P-type calcium channels, the kinetic reactions of endogenous and exogenous (mobile) buffers, the kinetic reactions for the secretory vesicles, as well as the microscopic diffusion of mobile buffers and calcium ions. The simulations are performed in a 3-D orthogonal grid which approximates a cylindrical domain representing an active zone of the presynaptic terminal of the calyx. For this domain, we quantify the release rates related to calcium currents in response to depolarizing voltage pulses. The influence on simulated pulse/action potential depolarization protocols of the kinetic scheme for the calcium sensor of vesicles and the geometry of calcium channels for the kinetic cooperativity for release, is analyzed at a microdomain level. Among other aspects, our results suggest that the spatial organization of Ca (2 +) channels could have measurable effects in the kinetic cooperativity which could reflect developing changes in the calyx of Held synapse.},

J Neurophysiol 103: 429-440, 2010. First published November 11, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.00679.2009. Stretch reflexes contribute to arm impedance and longer-latency stretch reflexes exhibit increased sensitivity during interactions with compliant or unstable environments. This increased sensitivity is consistent with a regulation of arm impedance to compensate for decreased stability of the environment, but the specificity of this modulation has yet to be investigated. Many tasks, such as tool use, compromise arm stability along specific directions, and stretch reflexes tuned to those directions could present an efficient mechanism for regulating arm impedance in a task-appropriate manner. To be effective, such tuning should adapt not only to the mechanical properties of the environment but to those properties in relation to the arm, which also has directionally specific mechanical properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the specificity of stretch reflex modulation during interactions with mechanical environments that challenge arm stability. The tested environments were unstable, having the characteristics of a negative stiffness spring. These were either aligned or orthogonal to the direction of maximal endpoint stiffness for each subject. Our results demonstrate preferential increases in reflexes, elicited within 50-100 ms of perturbation onset, to perturbations applied specifically along the direction of the destabilizing environments. This increase occurred only when the magnitude of the environmental instability exceeded endpoint stiffness along the same direction. These results are consistent with task-specific reflex modulation tuned to the mechanical properties of the environment relative to those of the human arm. They demonstrate a highly adaptable, involuntary mechanism that may be used to modulate limb impedance along specific directions.},

abstract = {The problem of how the nervous system fuses sensory information from multiple modalities for upright stance control remains largely unsolved. It is well established that the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory modalities provide position and rate (e.g., velocity, acceleration) information for estimation of body dynamics. However, it is unknown whether any particular property dominates when multisensory information is fused. Our recent stochastic analysis of postural sway during quiet stance suggested that sensory input provides more accurate information about the body's velocity than its position or acceleration. Here we tested this prediction by degrading major sources of velocity information through removal/attenuation of sensory information from vision and proprioception. Experimental measures of postural sway were compared with model predictions to determine whether sway behavior was indicative of a deficit in velocity information rather than position or acceleration information. Subjects stood with eyes closed on a support surface that was 1) fixed, 2) foam, or 3) sway-referenced. Six measures characterizing the stochastic structure of postural sway behaved in a manner consistent with model predictions of degraded velocity information. Results were inconsistent with the effect of degrading only position or acceleration information. These findings support the hypothesis that velocity information is the most accurate form of sensory information used to stabilize posture during quiet stance. Our results are consistent with the assumption that changes in sway behavior resulting from commonly used experimental manipulations (e.g., foam, sway-referencing, eyes closed) are primarily attributed to loss of accurate velocity information.},

Net muscle force recorded during voluntary contractions with multiple agonist muscles is the summated result of individual muscle forces. The purpose of this article is to synthesize recent findings from several studies oil the modulations of muscle activity and force fluctuations during steady voluntary contractions with multiple agonist muscles in humans. During a sustained low-farce contraction with the knee extensor Muscles, fluctuations in knee extension force changed concurrently with the involuntary alternate muscle activity between the rectus femoris muscle and the vasti muscles. After prolonged bed rest, the amount of change in the fluctuations in net force was associated with the amount of change in the EMG distribution among individual muscles within the knee extensor group and the ankle extensor group. As an adaptation to bed rest, an increase in the fluctuations in plantarflexion force accompanied an increase in the relative contribution of the medial gastrocnemius muscle to net force. In contrast, an increased contribution of the medial gastrocnemius by air acute increase in Muscle length reduced force fluctuations. The discrepancy in the changes in force fluctuations due to an increased contribution of the medial gastrocnemius between two interventions (bed rest and muscle length change) is associated with increased low-frequency power in the EMG of the medial gastrocnemius after bed rest. In summary, tire fluctuations in net force were influenced by the alteration in muscle activity among agonist muscles in terms of relative contributions to net force and frequency characteristics.},

abstract = {The effects of aging on motoneuron firing rates and muscle contractile properties were studied in tibialis anterior muscle by comparing results from six young (20.8 +/- 0.8 yr) and six old men (82.0 +/- 1.7 yr). For each subject, data were collected from repeated tests over a 2-wk period. Contractile tests included maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) with twitch interpolation and stimulated twitch contractions. The old men had 26{\%} lower MVC torque (P < 0.01) than did the young men, but percent activation was not different (99.1 and 99.3{\%}, respectively). Twitch contraction durations were 23{\%} longer (P < 0.01) in the old compared with the young men. During a series of repeated brief steady-state contractions at 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100{\%} MVC, motor unit firing rates were recorded. Results from approximately 950 motor unit trains in each subject group indicated that at all relative torque levels mean firing rates were 30-35{\%} lower (P < 0.01) in the old subjects. Comparisons between young and old subjects' mean firing rates at each of 10{\%}, 50{\%}, and MVC torques and their corresponding mean twitch contraction duration yielded a range of moderate-to-high correlations (r = -0.67 to -0.84). That lower firing rates were matched to longer twitch contraction durations in the muscle of old men, and relatively higher firing rates were matched with shorter contraction times from the young men, indirectly supports the neuromuscular age-related remodeling principle.},

@article{Loram2007,
abstract = {Using short duration perturbations, previous attempts to measure the intrinsic ankle stiffness during human standing have revealed a substantial stabilizing contribution (65-90{\%} normalized to load stiffness 'mgh'). Others regard this method as unsuitable for the low-frequency conditions of quiet standing and believe the passive contribution to be small (10-15{\%}). This latter view, consistent with a linear Hill-type model, argues that during standing, the contractile portion of the muscle is much less stiff than the tendon. Here, for upright subjects, we settle this issue by measuring the stiffness of the contractile portion of the passive calf muscles using low-frequency ankle rotations. Using ultrasound we tracked the changes in muscle contractile length and partitioned the ankle rotation into contractile and extra-contractile (series elastic) portions. Small ankle rotations of 0.15 and 0.4 deg show a contractile to series elastic stiffness ratio (K-ce/K-se) of 12 +/- 9 and 6.3 +/- 10, respectively, with both elements displaying predominantly elastic behaviour. Larger, 7 deg rotations reveal the range of this ratio. It declines in a non-linear way from a high value (K-ce/K-se = 18 +/- 11) to a low value (KcelK,, = I 0.4) as rotation increases from 0.1 to 7 deg. There is a marked transition at around 0.5 deg. The series elastic stiffness (K-se/mgh) remains largely constant (77 +/- 13{\%}) demonstrating the contractile component origin of passive, short range stiffness. The linear Hill-type model does not describe the range-related stiffness relevant to the progression from quiet standing to perturbed balance and movement and can lead to inaccurate predictions regarding human balance.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare spatial electromyographic (EMG) potential distribution during force production between elderly and young individuals using multi-channel surface EMG (SEMG). Thirteen elderly (72-79years) and 13 young (21-27years) healthy male volunteers performed ramp submaximal contraction during isometric knee extension from 0{\{}{\%}{\}} to 65{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximal voluntary contraction. During contraction, multi-channel EMG was recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle. To evaluate alteration in heterogeneity and pattern in spatial EMG potential distribution, coefficient of variation (CoV), modified entropy and correlation coefficients with initial torque level were calculated from multi-channel SEMG at 5{\{}{\%}{\}} force increment. Increase in CoV and decrease in modified entropy of RMS with increase of exerted torque were significantly smaller in elderly group (p<0.05) and correlation coefficients with initial torque level were significantly higher in elderly group than in young group at moderate torque levels (p<0.05). These data suggest that the increase of heterogeneity and the change in the activation pattern are smaller in elderly individuals than in young individuals. We speculated that multi-channel SEMG pattern in elderly individual reflects neuromuscular activation strategy regulated predominantly by clustering of similar type of muscle fibers in aged muscle.},

abstract = {The objective of this project was to examine the influence of stimulus waveform and frequency on extracellular stimulation of neurons with their cell bodies near the electrode (local cells) and fibers of passage in the CNS. Detailed computer-based models of CNS cells and axons were developed that accurately reproduced the dynamic firing properties of mammalian motoneurons including afterpotential shape, spike-frequency adaptation, and firing frequency as a function of stimulus amplitude. The neuron models were coupled to a three-dimensional finite element model of the spinal cord that solved for the potentials generated in the tissue medium by an extracellular electrode. Extracellular stimulation of the CNS with symmetrical charge balanced biphasic stimuli resulted in activation of fibers of passage, axon terminals, and local cells around the electrode at similar thresholds. While high stimulus frequencies enhanced activation of fibers of passage, a much more robust technique to achieve selective activation of targeted neuronal populations was via alterations in the stimulus waveform. Asymmetrical charge-balanced biphasic stimuli, consisting of a long-duration low-amplitude cathodic prepulse phase followed by a short-duration high-amplitude anodic stimulus phase, enabled selective activation of local cells. Conversely, an anodic prepulse phase followed by a cathodic stimulus phase enabled selective activation of fibers of passage. The threshold for activation of axon terminals in the vicinity of the electrode was lower than the threshold for direct activation of local cells, independent of the stimulus waveform. As a result, stimulation induced trans-synaptic influences (indirect depolarization/hyperpolarization) on local cells altered their neural output, and this indirect effect was dependent on stimulus frequency. If the indirect activation of local cells was inhibitory, there was little effect on the stimulation induced neural output of the local cells. However, if the indirect activation of the local cells was excitatory, attempts to activate selectively fibers of passage over local cells was limited. These outcomes provide a biophysical basis for understanding frequency-dependent outputs during CNS stimulation and provide useful tools for selective stimulation of the CNS.},

abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to compare two different feedback controllers for the stabilization of quiet standing in humans, taking into account that the intrinsic ankle stiffness is insufficient and that there is a large delay inducing instability in the feedback loop: 1) a standard linear, continuous-time PD controller and 2) an intermittent PD controller characterized by a switching function defined in the phase plane, with or without a dead zone around the nominal equilibrium state. The stability analysis of the first controller is carried out by using the standard tools of linear control systems, whereas the analysis of the intermittent controllers is based on the use of Poincar{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} maps defined in the phase plane. When the PD-control is off, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a saddle-like equilibrium, with a stable and an unstable manifold. The switching function of the intermittent controller is implemented in such a way that PD-control is 'off' when the state vector is near the stable manifold of the saddle and is 'on' otherwise. A theoretical analysis and a related simulation study show that the intermittent control model is much more robust than the standard model because the size of the region in the parameter space of the feedback control gains (P vs. D) that characterizes stable behavior is much larger in the latter case than in the former one. Moreover, the intermittent controller can use feedback parameters that are much smaller than the standard model. Typical sway patterns generated by the intermittent controller are the result of an alternation between slow motion along the stable manifold of the saddle, when the PD-control is off, and spiral motion away from the upright equilibrium determined by the activation of the PD-control with low feedback gains. Remarkably, overall dynamic stability can be achieved by combining in a smart way two unstable regimes: a saddle and an unstable spiral. The intermittent controller exploits the stabilizing effect of one part of the saddle, letting the system evolve by alone when it slides on or near the stable manifold; when the state vector enters the strongly unstable part of the saddle it switches on a mild feedback which is not supposed to impose a strict stable regime but rather to mitigate the impending fall. The presence of a dead zone in the intermittent controller does not alter the stability properties but improves the similarity with biological sway patterns. The two types of controllers are also compared in the frequency domain by considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the sway sequences generated by the models with additive noise. Different from the standard continuous model, whose PSD function is similar to an over-damped second order system without a resonance, the intermittent control model is capable to exhibit the two power law scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway movements in humans.},

abstract = {Neurological or biomechanical disorders may distort ankle mechanical impedance and thereby impair locomotor function. This paper presents a quantitative characterization of multivariable ankle mechanical impedance of young healthy subjects when their muscles were relaxed, to serve as a baseline to compare with pathophysiological ankle properties of biomechanically and/or neurologically impaired patients. Measurements using a highly backdrivable wearable ankle robot combined with multi-input multi-output stochastic system identification methods enabled reliable characterization of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) simultaneously, the sagittal and frontal planes. The characterization included important ankle properties unavailable from single DOF studies: coupling between DOFs and anisotropy as a function of frequency. Ankle impedance in joint coordinates showed responses largely consistent with a 2nd order system consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both seated (knee flexed) and standing (knee straightened) postures. Stiffness in the sagittal plane was greater than in the frontal plane and furthermore, was greater when standing than when seated, most likely due to the stretch of bi-articular muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius). Very low off-diagonal partial coherences implied negligible coupling between dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion. The directions of principal axes were tilted slightly counterclockwise from the original joint coordinates. The directional variation (anisotropy) of ankle impedance in the 2D-space formed by rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes exhibited a characteristic "peanut" shape, weak in inversion-eversion over a wide range of frequencies from the stiffness dominated region up to the inertia dominated region. Implications for the assessment of neurological and biomechanical impairments are discussed.},

abstract = {System identification techniques applied to experimental human-in-the-loop data provide an objective test of three alternative control-theoretical models of the human control system: non-predictive control, predictive control, and intermittent predictive control. A two-stage approach to the identification of a single-input single-output control system is used: first, the closed-loop frequency response is derived using the periodic property of the experimental data, followed by the fitting of a parametric model. While this approach is well-established for non-predictive and predictive control, it is here used for the first time with intermittent predictive control. This technique is applied to data from experiments with human volunteers who use one of two control strategies, focusing either on position or on velocity, to manually control a virtual, unstable load which requires sustained feedback to maintain position or low velocity. The results show firstly that the non-predictive controller does not fit the data as well as the other two models, and secondly that the predictive and intermittent predictive controllers provide equally good models which cannot be distinguished using this approach. Importantly, the second observation implies that sustained visual manual control is compatible with intermittent control, and that previous results suggesting a continuous control model for the human control system do not rule out intermittent control as an alternative hypothesis. Thirdly, the parameters identified reflect the control strategy adopted by the human controller.},

abstract = {1. We describe a simulator for neural networks and action potentials (SNNAP) that can simulate up to 30 neurons, each with up to 30 voltage-dependent conductances, 30 electrical synapses, and 30 multicomponent chemical synapses. Voltage-dependent conductances are described by Hodgkin-Huxley type equations, and the contributions of time-dependent synaptic conductances are described by second-order differential equations. The program also incorporates equations for simulating different types of neural modulation and synaptic plasticity. 2. Parameters, initial conditions, and output options for SNNAP are passed to the program through a number of modular ASCII files. These modules can be modified by commonly available text editors that use a conventional (i.e., character based) interface or by an editor incorporated into SNNAP that uses a graphical interface. The modular design facilitates the incorporation of existing modules into new simulations. Thus libraries can be developed of files describing distinctive cell types and files describing distinctive neural networks. 3. Several different types of neurons with distinct biophysical properties and firing properties were simulated by incorporating different combinations of voltage-dependent Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels as well as Ca(2+)-activated and Ca(2+)-inactivated channels. Simulated cells included those that respond to depolarization with tonic firing, adaptive firing, or plateau potentials as well as endogenous pacemaker and bursting cells. 4. Several types of simple neural networks were simulated that included feed-forward excitatory and inhibitory chemical synaptic connections, a network of electrically coupled cells, and a network with feedback chemical synaptic connections that simulated rhythmic neural activity. In addition, with the use of the equations describing electrical coupling, current flow in a branched neuron with 18 compartments was simulated. 5. Enhancement of excitability and enhancement of transmitter release, produced by modulatory transmitters, were simulated by second-messenger-induced modulation of K+ currents. A depletion model for synaptic depression was also simulated. 6. We also attempted to simulate the features of a more complicated central pattern generator, inspired by the properties of neurons in the buccal ganglia of Aplysia. Dynamic changes in the activity of this central pattern generator were produced by a second-messenger-induced modulation of a slow inward current in one of the neurons.},

abstract = {We developed a model to investigate the influence of the muscle force twitch on the simulated firing behavior of motoneurons and muscle force production during voluntary isometric contractions. The input consists of an excitatory signal common to all the motor units in the pool of a muscle, consistent with the "common drive" property. Motor units respond with a hierarchically structured firing behavior wherein at any time and force, firing rates are inversely proportional to recruitment threshold, as described by the "onion skin" property. Time- and force-dependent changes in muscle force production are introduced by varying the motor unit force twitches as a function of time or by varying the number of active motor units. A force feedback adjusts the input excitation, maintaining the simulated force at a target level. The simulations replicate motor unit behavior characteristics similar to those reported in previous empirical studies of sustained contractions: 1) the initial decrease and subsequent increase of firing rates, 2) the derecruitment and recruitment of motor units throughout sustained contractions, and 3) the continual increase in the force fluctuation caused by the progressive recruitment of larger motor units. The model cautions the use of motor unit behavior at recruitment and derecruitment without consideration of changes in the muscle force generation capacity. It describes an alternative mechanism for the reserve capacity of motor units to generate extraordinary force. It supports the hypothesis that the control of motoneurons remains invariant during force-varying and sustained isometric contractions.},

The building blocks with which the central nervous system constructs these motor patterns can be preserved in patients with various sensory-motor disorders. In particular, several studies highlighted a modular burst-like organization of the muscle activity. Here we review and discuss this issue with a particular emphasis on the various examples of adaptation of locomotor patterns in patients (with large fiber neuropathy, amputees, stroke and spinal cord injury). The results highlight plasticity and different solutions to reorganize muscle patterns in both peripheral and central nervous system lesions. The findings are discussed in a general context of compensatory gait mechanisms, spatiotemporal architecture and modularity of the locomotor program.},

abstract = {The existence of transcortical reflex pathways in the control of distal arm and hand muscles in man is now widely accepted. Much more controversy exists regarding a possible contribution of such reflexes to the control of leg muscles. It is often assumed that transcortical reflex pathways play no, or only a minor, role in the control of leg muscles. Transcortical reflex pathways according to this view are reserved for the control of the distal upper limb and are seen in close relation to the evolution of the primate hand. Here we review data, which provide evidence that transcortical reflexes do exist for lower limb muscles and may play a significant role in the control of at least some of these muscles. This evidence is based on animal research, recent experiments combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with peripheral electrical and mechanical stimulation in healthy subjects and neurological patients. We propose that afferent activity from muscle and skin may play a role in the regulation of bipedal gait through transcortical pathways.},

abstract = {Control of bipedal standing is typically analyzed in the context of a single-segment inverted pendulum model. The stiffness K (SE) of the series elastic element that transmits the force generated by the contractile elements of the ankle plantarflexors to the skeletal system has been reported to be smaller in magnitude than the destabilizing gravitational stiffness K ( g ). In this study, we assess, in case K (SE) + K ( g ) < 0, if bipedal standing can be locally stable under direct feedback of contractile element length, contractile element velocity (both sensed by muscle spindles) and muscle force (sensed by Golgi tendon organs) to alpha-motoneuron activity. A theoretical analysis reveals that even though positive feedback of force may increase the stiffness of the muscle-tendon complex to values well over the destabilizing gravitational stiffness, dynamic instability makes it impossible to obtain locally stable standing under the conditions assumed.},

abstract = {Correlated spiking has been widely observed, but its impact on neural coding remains controversial. Correlation arising from comodulation of rates across neurons has been shown to vary with the firing rates of individual neurons. This translates into rate and correlation being equivalently tuned to the stimulus; under those conditions, correlated spiking does not provide information beyond that already available from individual neuron firing rates. Such correlations are irrelevant and can reduce coding efficiency by introducing redundancy. Using simulations and experiments in rat hippocampal neurons, we show here that pairs of neurons receiving correlated input also exhibit correlations arising from precise spike-time synchronization. Contrary to rate comodulation, spike-time synchronization is unaffected by firing rate, thus enabling synchrony- and rate-based coding to operate independently. The type of output correlation depends on whether intrinsic neuron properties promote integration or coincidence detection: "ideal" integrators (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus mean) exhibit rate comodulation, whereas ideal coincidence detectors (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus variance) exhibit precise spike-time synchronization. Pyramidal neurons are sensitive to both stimulus mean and variance, and thus exhibit both types of output correlation proportioned according to which operating mode is dominant. Our results explain how different types of correlations arise based on how individual neurons generate spikes, and why spike-time synchronization and rate comodulation can encode different stimulus properties. Our results also highlight the importance of neuronal properties for population-level coding insofar as neural networks can employ different coding schemes depending on the dominant operating mode of their constituent neurons.},

abstract = {Healthy humans control balance during stance by using an active feedback mechanism that generates corrective torque based on a combination of movement and orientation cues from visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems. Previous studies found that the contribution of each of these sensory systems changes depending on perturbations applied during stance and on environmental conditions. The process of adjusting the sensory contributions to balance control is referred to as sensory reweighting. To investigate the dynamics of reweighting for the sensory modalities of vision and proprioception, 14 healthy young subjects were exposed to six different combinations of continuous visual scene and platform tilt stimuli while sway responses were recorded. Stimuli consisted of two components: 1) a pseudorandom component whose amplitude periodically switched between low and high amplitudes and 2) a low-amplitude sinusoidal component whose amplitude remained constant throughout a trial. These two stimuli were mathematically independent of one another and, thus, permitted separate analyses of sway responses to the two components. For all six stimulus combinations, the sway responses to the constant-amplitude sine were influenced by the changing amplitude of the pseudorandom component in a manner consistent with sensory reweighting. Results show clear evidence of intra- and intermodality reweighting. Reweighting dynamics were asymmetric, with slower reweighting dynamics following a high-to-low transition in the pseudorandom stimulus amplitude compared with low-to-high amplitude shifts, and were also slower for inter- compared with intramodality reweighting.},

abstract = {Methods are described for estimating the inertia, viscosity, and stiffness of the lower leg around the knee and of the whole leg around the hip that are applicable even to persons with considerable spasticity. These involve: 1) a “pull” test in which the limb is slowly moved throughout its range of motion while measuring angles (with an electrogoniometer) and torques (with a hand-held dynamometer) to determine passive stiffness and 2) a “pendulum” test in which the limb is moved against gravity and then dropped, while again measuring angles and torques. By limiting the extent of the movement and choosing a direction (flexion or extension) that minimizes reflex responses, the mechanical parameters can be determined accurately and efficiently using computer programs. In the sample of subjects studied (nine with disability related to spinal cord injury, head injury, or stroke, and nine with no neurological disability), the inertia of the lower leg was significantly reduced in the subjects with disability 0, < 0.05) as a result of atrophy, but the stiffness and viscosity were within normal limits. The values of inertia were also compared with anthropometric data in the literature. The identification of these passive parameters is particularly important in designing systems for functional electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles, but the methods may be widely applicable in rehabilitation medicine.},

abstract = {It is well known that the human postural control system responds to motion of the visual scene, but the implicit assumptions it makes about the visual environment and what quantities, if any, it estimates about the visual environment are unknown. This study compares the behavior of four models of the human postural control system to experimental data. Three include internal models that estimate the state of the visual environment, implicitly assuming its dynamics to be that of a linear stochastic process (respectively, a random walk, a general first-order process, and a general second-order process). In each case, all of the coefficients that describe the process are estimated by an adaptive scheme based on maximum likelihood. The fourth model does not estimate the state of the visual environment. It adjusts sensory weights to minimize the mean square of the control signal without making any specific assumptions about the dynamic properties of the environmental motion. We find that both having an internal model of the visual environment and its type make a significant difference in how the postural system responds to motion of the visual scene. Notably, the second-order process model outperforms the human postural system in its response to sinusoidal stimulation. Specifically, the second-order process model can correctly identify the frequency of the stimulus and completely compensate so that the motion of the visual scene has no effect on sway. In this case the postural control system extracts the same information from the visual modality as it does when the visual scene is stationary. The fourth model that does not simulate the motion of the visual environment is the only one that reproduces the experimentally observed result that, across different frequencies of sinusoidal stimulation, the gain with respect to the stimulus drops as the amplitude of the stimulus increases but the phase remains roughly constant. Our results suggest that the human postural control system does not estimate the state of the visual environment to respond to sinusoidal stimuli.},

The model is an integration of a biologically realistic neural network consisting of motoneurons and interneurons, modeling 12 populations of spinal neurons, and a one degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model, including proprioceptors. The model could mimic the findings of human postural experiments, using presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferents to modulate the feedback gains. In a pathological case, disabling one specific neural connection between the inhibitory interneurons and the motoneurons could mimic the experimental findings in complex regional pain syndrome patients. It is concluded that the model is a valuable tool to gain insight into the spinal contributions to human motor control. Applications lay in the fields of human motor control and neurological disorders, where hypotheses on motor dysfunction can be tested, like spasticity, clonus, and tremor.},

abstract = {Objective To understand and examine the relation between postural response latencies obtained during postural perturbations and representative measures of balance during standing (sway variables) and walking (trunk motion). Design Cross-sectional. Setting University medical center. Participants Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (n=20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of <5 seconds. Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables. Results We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: $\rho$=.334, P=.04; range: $\rho$=.385, P=.017; mean velocity: $\rho$=.337, P=.038; total sway area: $\rho$=.393, P=.015). Postural response latency was also significantly correlated with motion of the trunk during walking (sagittal plane range of motion: $\rho$=.316, P=.05; SD of transverse plane range of motion: $\rho$=-.43, P=.006). Conclusions These findings clearly indicate that slow postural responses to external perturbations in patients with MS contribute to disturbances in balance control during both standing and walking. © 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {In a standing position, the vertical projection of the center of mass passes in front of the ankle, which requires active plantar-flexor torque from the triceps surae to maintain balance. We recorded motor unit (MU) activity in the medial (MG) and lateral (LG) gastrocnemius muscle and the soleus (SOL) in standing balance and voluntary isometric contractions to understand the effect of functional requirements and descending drive from different neural sources on motoneuron behavior. Single MU activity was recorded in seven subjects with wire electrodes in the triceps surae. Two 3-min standing balance trials and several ramp-and-hold contractions were performed. Lateral gastrocnemius MU activity was rarely observed in standing. The lowest thresholds for LG MUs in ramp contractions were 20-35 times higher than SOL and MG MUs (P < 0.001). Compared with MUs from the SOL, MG MUs were intermittently active (P < 0.001), had higher recruitment thresholds (P = 0.022), and greater firing rate variability (P < 0.001); this difference in firing rate variability was present in standing balance and isometric contractions. In SOL and MG MUs, both recruitment of new MUs (R(2) = 0.59-0.79, P < 0.01) and MU firing rates (R(2) = 0.05-0.40, P < 0.05) were associated with anterior-posterior and medio-lateral torque in standing. Our results suggest that the two heads of the gastrocnemius may operate in different ankle ranges with the larger MG being of primary importance when standing, likely due to its fascicle orientation. These differences in MU discharge behavior were independent of the type of descending neural drive, which points to a muscle-specific optimization of triceps surae motoneurons.},

abstract = {According to Henneman's size principle, small motor units are recruited before large ones. It is commonly believed that this can be detected in routine conventional EMG recordings even among the earliest recruited motor units. That is, the MUP amplitude, area, and thickness should increase with recruitment order. We studied the first four motor unit potentials (MUPs) recruited within the pickup area of the electrodes. Data were obtained from 179 different sites in monopolar recordings and in 153 concentric recordings from 5 health subjects, In the pooled material, amplitude, area, and thickness increased slightly between consecutively recruited MUPs, However, at individual recording sites the size of consecutively recruited MUPs varied considerably. At some recording sites the first recruited MUP had the largest amplitude and the later MUPs has successively smaller amplitudes. We conclude that, at individual recording sites, the size principle cannot be detected in low threshold motor units with monopolar or concentric EMG electrodes. The reason for this is the small uptake area of these electrodes in relation to the motor unit territory. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Uncovering how motoneurons utilize their voltage-sensitive conductances to systematically respond to a variety of inputs is paramount to understanding synaptic integration. In this study, we examine the input dynamics and frequency-dependent characteristics of active conductances in motoneurons as viewed from the soma in the decerebrate cat. We evaluated the somatic response of the motoneuron by superimposing a voltage sinus sweep (a sine wave in which frequency increases with time, which is often referred to as a zap or chirp) at a subset of membrane holding potentials during discontinuous, single-electrode, somatic voltage-clamp. Results from both experimental and modeling data indicate that ionic conductances can respond to a wide variety of input dynamics. Notably, it appears that there is a divergence between low input conductance type S and high input conductance type FF motoneurons in their response to input frequency. Type S motoneurons generate a larger response to lower frequency input dynamics (compared with their response to higher frequencies), whereas type FF generate a larger response to higher input frequency dynamics. Functionally, these results may indicate that motoneurons on the lower end of the motor pool (i.e., recruited first) may favor steady inputs, whereas motoneurons at the higher end (i.e., recruited later) may favor input transients in producing action potentials.},

abstract = {Antispastic medication is often used in the clinic together with physiotherapy. However, some of the antispastic drugs, e.g., baclofen and diazepam, may influence the plastic mechanisms that are necessary for motor learning and hence efficient physiotherapy. In the present study, we consequently investigated the influence of baclofen and diazepam on acquisition of a visuomotor skill. The study was designed as a semi-randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 16 healthy human subjects. The motor skill task required the subjects to match a given force trajectory by increasing or decreasing ankle dorsiflexor torque. Subjects trained for a total of 30 min. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex leg area was applied to elicit motor evoked potentials in the anterior tibial muscle (TA). Coupling between populations of TA motor units was calculated in the frequency (coherence) domain during isometric dorsiflexion. Subjects receiving placebo showed statistically significant improvement in motor performance (q = 34.1, P = 0.014) accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in intramuscular coherence. Subjects receiving baclofen and diazepam conversely showed no progression in motor performance (P > 0.05), and the training was not accompanied by a decrease in intramuscular coherence. TA motor evoked potentials had significantly lower threshold following the training in the placebo group, whereas this was not the case in the treatment groups. These data indicate that diazepam and baclofen interfere with the acquisition of a motor skill by disrupting some of the neuroplastic changes that are involved in improved motor performance. This suggests that antispastic treatment should be used with caution in subjects receiving concomitant physiotherapy.},

abstract = {Walking is a constrained movement which may best be observed during the double stance phase when both feet contact the floor. When analyzing a measured movement with an inverse dynamics model, a violation of these constraints will always occur due to measuring errors and deviations of the segments model from reality, leading to inconsistent results. Consistency is obtained by implementing the constraints into the model. This makes it possible to combine the inverse dynamics model with optimization techniques in order to predict walking patterns or to reconstruct non-measured rotations when only a part of the three-dimensional joint rotations is measured. In this paper the outlines of the extended inverse dynamics method are presented, the constraints which define walking are defined and the optimization procedure is described. The model is applied to analyze a normal walking pattern of which only the hip, knee and ankle flexions/extensions are measured. This input movement is reconstructed to a kinematically and dynamically consistent three-dimensional movement, and the joint forces (including the ground reaction forces) and joint moments of force, needed to bring about this movement are estimated.},

abstract = {Balance control during upright standing is accompanied by an increased amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation and a decreased amplitude of the Hoffmann (H) reflex in the soleus muscle. Nonetheless, whether these observations reflect reciprocal adjustments between corticospinal and group I afferents pathways during upright standing remains unknown. To further investigate this question, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) applied over the motor cortex and vibration of Achilles tendons were used to modify the excitability of corticospinal and group I afferent pathways, respectively. MEPs and H reflexes were recorded in the soleus muscle during upright standing with or without bilateral Achilles tendon vibration, these recordings being performed before and after 20. min of c-tDCS (1.5. mA) or sham stimulation applied over the sensorimotor cortex. The results indicate that tendon vibration increased MEP amplitude (+28{\{}{\%}{\}}) and decrease (-68{\{}{\%}{\}}) the H-reflex amplitude (p<. 0.05). After c-tDCS, MEP amplitude was reduced by 13{\{}{\%}{\}} and 26{\{}{\%}{\}} without and with tendon vibration (p<. 0.05), respectively. In contrast, no significant change occurred in H-reflex amplitude after c-tDCS. Regardless of the conditions (c-tDCS and tendon vibration), no significant correlation was observed between changes in MEP and H-reflex amplitudes. The results failed to demonstrate close reciprocal changes in soleus MEP and H-reflex amplitudes during upright standing. These original findings suggest independent adjustments in corticospinal and group I afferents pathways during upright standing. © 2014.},

abstract = {Like many types of motoneurons, spinal motoneurons in the adult mammal can exhibit bistable behavior. This means that short periods of excitatory input can initiate long periods of self-sustained firing and that equally short periods of inhibition can return the cell to the quiescent state. Usually, the presence of one of the monoamines (either serotonin or norepinephrine) is required for spinal motoneurons to express bistable behaviors. Because the decerebrate cat preparation has tonic activity in monoaminergic fibers that originate in the brain stem and project to spinal motoneurons, these cells sometimes exhibit bistable behavior. However, exogenous application of the noradrenergic alpha, agonist methoxamine greatly enhances bistable behavior in the decerebrate. The goal of this study was to identify the mechanisms of this action of methoxamine. The total persistent inward current (I-PIC) in spinal motoneurons in the decerebrate cat was measured from I-V functions generated by triangular voltage commands applied using discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp. The effect of methoxamine on I-PIC was assessed by comparing its properties in a control cell sample without methoxamine to its properties in a sample of cells obtained after application of methoxamine. In most experiments, at least one cell:was obtained from each sample. Our results showed that methoxamine approximately doubled the amplitude of I-PIC without changing its Onset voltage, its offset voltage, or its persistence. The reduced amplitude was a consistent finding within experiments and so was unlikely to be caused by interanimal variability. In addition, methoxamine depolarized motoneurons without altering their input conductances, so that a smaller amount of current was required to reach the onset voltage of I-PIC These effects of methoxamine were approximately equal in all cells. As a result of these changes, methoxamine greatly enhanced the tendency for motoneurons to become bistable. It is proposed that the methoxamine-induced increase in the amplitude of I-PIC is effective in enhancing the duration of bistable firing because this increase makes I-PIC more resistant to the deactivating effects of the afterhyperpolarizations between spikes.},

abstract = {Upper motor neuron diseases (UMND), such as stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI), are assumed to produce alterations in muscle tissue in association with neural damage. Distinguishing between these two factors is of clinical importance in choosing appropriate therapy. We studied the effect of changes in the gain of the Ia reflex pathway and tissue viscoelasticity on the emergence, frequency, and persistence of ankle clonus: a clinically significant, involuntary oscillatory movement disorder. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to explain our experimental observations in patients with stroke (n = 3) and SCI (n = 4) using a nonlinear antagonistic muscle model of the human ankle joint. Ia reflex gain was varied by changing motor unit pool threshold and gain, and passive tissue viscosity and elasticity were varied by changing optimal muscle length. Tissue viscoelasticity appeared to have a strong effect on the emergence and persistence of clonus. Observed frequencies of ankle movement, prior to and after the experimental intervention of a sudden damper, was predicted by the model. The simulations revealed that reflex gains were largest in patients with the largest tissue viscoelasticity. We conclude that ankle clonus in stroke and SCI is the result of a combination of, and suggests a relation between, (i) a decrease in threshold and an increase in gain of the motor unit pool and (ii) a decrease in optimal muscle length.},

abstract = {To keep balance, information from different sensory systems is integrated to generate corrective torques. Current literature suggests that this information is combined according to the sensory reweighting hypothesis, i.e., more reliable information is weighted more strongly than less reliable information. In this approach, no distinction has been made between the contributions of both legs. In this study, we investigated how proprioceptive information from both legs is combined to maintain upright stance. Healthy subjects maintained balance with eyes closed while proprioceptive information of each leg was perturbed independently by continuous rotations of the support surfaces (SS) and the human body by platform translation. Two conditions were tested: perturbation amplitude of one SS was increased over trials while the other SS 1) did not move or 2) was perturbed with constant amplitude. With the use of system identification techniques, the response of the ankle torques to the perturbation amplitudes (i.e., the torque sensitivity functions) was determined and how much each leg contributed to stabilize stance (i.e., stabilizing mechanisms) was estimated. Increased amplitude of one SS resulted in a decreased torque sensitivity. The torque sensitivity to the constant perturbed SS showed no significant differences. The properties of the stabilizing mechanisms remained constant during perturbations of each SS. This study demonstrates that proprioceptive information from each leg is weighted independently and that the weight decreases with perturbation amplitude. Weighting of proprioceptive information of one leg has no influence on the weight of the proprioceptive information of the other leg. According to the sensory reweighting hypothesis, vestibular information must be up-weighted, because closing the eyes eliminates visual information.},

The genetic episodic ataxias are a group of disorders with heterogeneous phenotype and genotype, but share in common the feature of intermittent cerebellar dysfunction. Episodic ataxia (EA) types 1 and 2 are the most widely recognised of the autosomal dominant episodic ataxias and are caused by dysfunction of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. There are central and peripheral nervous system manifestations in both conditions, and they are therefore good models of neuronal channelopathies to study neurophysiologically. To date most work has focussed upon characterising the electrophysiological properties of mutant channels in vitro. This review summarises the role of voltage-gated potassium and calcium channels, mutations of which underlie the main types of episodic ataxia types 1 and 2. The clinical, genetic and electrophysiological features of EA1 and EA2 are outlined, and a protocol for the assessment of these patients is proposed.},

abstract = {A clinical and electrophysiological study was performed in 119 Type 1A Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1A) patients with proven 17p11.2 duplication. Onset of the first functional manifestations was in the first decade in 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of cases and before the age of 20 years in 70{\{}{\%}{\}} of cases. The predominant clinical signs were muscle weakness and wasting in the lower limbs. None of the patients was normal on clinical examination and all presented at least pes cavus or ankle jerk areflexia. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was uniformly reduced in all nerves, and was < or = 33 m/s in the median nerve for all patients. Sensory potentials were abnormal in all cases, even where there was no clinical sensory loss. Needle electromyography recruitment was reduced in distal muscles for all patients. MNCV slowing was fully consistent with the presence of duplication even in clinically asymptomatic individuals or in children, confirming the complete electrophysiological penetrance of 17p11.2 duplication and making median nerve MNCV a reliable tool for screening affected at-risk individuals. Functional disability was mild. Ninety-six percent of patients were autonomous; 25{\{}{\%}{\}} were asymptomatic and diagnosed by systematic family investigation especially on the basis of median nerve MNCV reduction. Early age at onset and greatly reduced median nerve MNCV were predictive of a more severe disease course; the earlier the onset the more reduced the median nerve MNCV and the higher the functional disability tended to be after an equivalent disease duration. Cross-sectional analysis of neurological deficit, functional deficit and MNCV according to disease duration showed that, regardless of age at onset, CMT1A disease with 17p11.2 duplication is a clinically progressive disorder. Neurological deficit and functional disability increased, whereas median nerve MNCV and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude did not change with disease course. Intrafamilial phenotype variation between parents and children and between siblings was studied in large families. Functional disability and neurological deficit differed widely and the highest range of median nerve MNCV within a family reached 23 m/s. Clinical and electrophysiological data were compared with those of CMT1B patients with peripheral myelin P0 protein point mutation. CMT1A patients were found to be more severely affected with more prolonged distal motor latency and more reduced CMAP amplitude, whereas MNCV did not significantly differ, indicating that peripheral myelin P0 protein point mutation is not always associated with a severe phenotype. The same genetic defect (17p11.2 duplication) results in variable expression within the phenotype, even in siblings with variations in age at onset, clinical severity and MNCV slowing. This phenotypic variation could be due to additional genetic factors related to peripheral myelin protein 22 expression as well as to other endogenous or environmental factors.},

abstract = {I propose a transduction model of the Meissner corpuscle that integrates ideas put forth by Freeman and Johnson and results obtained by Looft. The principal development in the present model is its specification that RA receptor potentials are updated as a linear function of stimulus velocity above baseline; the model thus readily accommodates non-sinusoidal input. It also incorporates modifications to Freeman and Johnson's model proposed by Slavik and Bell, namely a period of refractoriness lasting 1 ms followed by a period of hyperexcitability lasting 13.5 ms. The model is applied to various psychophysical and physiological situations: psychophysical threshold vs. frequency, RA afferent impulse rates vs. intensity, impulse regularity vs. frequency, phase retardation vs. frequency, and responses to non-repeating noise and to complex stimuli. Model output closely matches psychophysical and neurophysiological data. The proposed model thus reliably predicts RA afferent responses to arbitrary stimuli and may facilitate the development of theories relating psychophysical phenomena to their underlying neural representations.

@article{Rafuse1997,
abstract = {1. The present study uses chronic low frequency stimulation of cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle to investigate the relative contribution of innervation ratio to the wide range of motor unit force in large mammalian muscles by reducing the normal variation in muscle fibre cross-sectional area and specific force. 2. Isometric force recordings from isolated and physiologically characterized motor units were made 42-240 days after stimulation. Innervation ratio, fibre area and fibre type (I, IIA, IIB) were determined in one glycogen-depleted motor unit per muscle. 3. After 42 days of stimulation, all motor units were non-fatigable and were classified as either slow (S) or fast-fatigue resistant (FR). Despite the absence of fast-fatigable (FF) motor units, all three muscle fibre types were present, as identified according to their myofibrillar ATPase reactivity. After 143 days, all motor units and muscle fibres were classified as type S and type I, respectively. 4. A rapid decline in muscle and motor unit force to 30{\%} of normal values after 42 days of chronic stimulation was accounted for by a reduction in muscle fibre area. Fibre areas did not change further with longer periods of stimulation but type II fibres were converted to type I. All stimulated muscle fibres were the size of normal type I fibres; the size of the fibres within single motor units covered the full range of the muscle fibre population. 5. In long-term stimulated muscles (> 100 days) when all muscle fibres were type I and all motor units type S, only differences in innervation ratio could account for the remaining range in motor unit force. Estimates of this range from the minimum and maximum values recorded and from values of tetanic force between the 5th and 95th percentiles indicate that the range in innervation ratio in the MG muscles is at least 15-fold and may be as large as 38-fold. Enumerations of glycogen-depleted muscle fibres from single motor units were consistent with this explanation. 6. The findings provide evidence that there is a wide range of innervation ratios in large muscles, which can account for the large range in motor unit forces in the muscles. Since motor unit force and innervation ratio vary with motoneurone size, these studies provide further support that the size of the peripheral field of innervation of motoneurones is related to their size.},

abstract = {Measurement of the average muscle fibre conduction velocity from surface electromyographic signals has important applications in the study of muscle fatigue and in ergonomics. In this paper, a two-channel hardware polarity correlator (which estimates 256 correlation coefficients per channel at a sampling rate of 18.58 kHz) and a specially designed surface electrode unit, are used to investigate various factors affecting the measurement reliability: electrode dimensions; EMG preprocessing to make the estimated correlation function more suitable for time delay measurement; and the manner in which velocity estimates, measured simultaneously from two different sections of the same muscle, are related. All the tests were performed on the biceps brachii when under medium tension; some tests involved tensions which led to muscle fatigue. Results showed that smaller electrode dimensions (i.e. smaller electrode units) and EMG preprocessing to increase its effective bandwidth, give more reliable measurements. Further, it was found that the estimated mean velocity is dependent on the location of the electrode unit on the muscle, and that at certain locations no reliable estimates can be obtained. The preliminary results obtained with muscle fatigue indicate that the estimated conduction velocity decreases, but not uniformly, across the muscle.},

abstract = {When calculating correlation networks from multi-electrode array (MEA) data, one works with extensive computations. Unfortunately, as the MEAs grow bigger, the time needed for the computation grows even more: calculating pair-wise correlations for current 60 channel systems can take hours on normal commodity computers whereas for future 1000 channel systems it would take almost 280 times as long, given that the number of pairs increases with the square of the number of channels. Even taking into account the increase of speed in processors, soon it can be unfeasible to compute correlations in a single computer. Parallel computing is a way to sustain reasonable calculation times in the future. We provide a general tool for rapid computation of correlation networks which was tested for: (a) a single computer cluster with 16 cores, (b) the Newcastle Condor System utilizing idle processors of university computers and (c) the inter-cluster, with 192 cores. Our reusable tool provides a simple interface for neuroscientists, automating data partition and job submission, and also allowing coding in any programming language. It is also sufficiently flexible to be used in other high-performance computing environments.},

Data-driven or 'inductive' advances in scientific knowledge are then seen as marginal, irrelevant, insecure or wrong-headed, while the development of technology--which is not of itself 'hypothesis-led' (beyond the recognition that such tools might be of value)--must be seen as equally irrelevant to the hypothetico-deductive scientific agenda. We argue here that data- and technology-driven programmes are not alternatives to hypothesis-led studies in scientific knowledge discovery but are complementary and iterative partners with them. Many fields are data-rich but hypothesis-poor. Here, computational methods of data analysis, which may be automated, provide the means of generating novel hypotheses, especially in the post-genomic era.},

abstract = {The cortical control of fast and slow muscles of the ankle has been the subject of numerous reports yielding conflicting results. Although it is generally agreed that cortical stimulation yields short latency facilitation of fast muscles, the effects on the slow muscle, soleus, remain controversial. Some studies have shown predominant facilitation of soleus from the cortex while others have provided evidence of differential control in which soleus is predominantly inhibited from the cortex. The objective of this study was to investigate the cortical control of fast and slow muscles of the ankle using stimulus triggered averaging (StTA) of EMG activity, which is a sensitive method of detecting output effects on muscle activity. This method also has relatively high spatial resolution and can be applied in awake, behaving subjects. Two rhesus macaques were trained to perform a hindlimb push-pull task. Stimulus triggered averages (StTAs) of EMG activity (15, 30, and 60 $\mu$A at 15 Hz) were computed for four muscles of the ankle [tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and soleus] as the monkeys performed the task. Poststimulus facilitation (PStF) was observed in both the fast muscles (TA, MG, and LG) as well as the slow muscle (soleus) and was as common and as strong in soleus as in the fast muscles. However, while poststimulus suppression (PStS) was observed in all muscles, it was more common in the slow muscle compared to the fast muscles and was as common as facilitation at low stimulus intensities. Overall, our results demonstrate that cortical facilitation of soleus has an organization that is very similar to that of the fast ankle muscles. However, cortical inhibition is organized differently allowing for more prominent suppression of soleus motoneurons.},

This is perhaps not surprising given that the principles of organization of local spinal microcircuits remain elusive--we have glimpses of an underlying order but lack a comprehensive view of their functional architecture.

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to assess the potentially different effects of impaired proprioceptive input in balance control under static and dynamic conditions in neuropathic patients. We recruited 20 normal subjects and 27 patients affected by neuropathies known to affect to a different extent large and medium size afferent fibres. The patients comprised 5 with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), 8 with CMT type 2 (CMT2) and 14 with Diabetes polyneuropathy (Diabetics). Measurement of balance during quiet stance on a stabilometric platform showed that sway area (SA) was larger in the CMT2 and Diabetics than normal subjects or in CMT1A, under both eyes open and closed conditions. The estimated conduction velocity (CV) of the group II afferent fibres was lower in CMT2 and Diabetics than in normal subjects and CMT1A. Across all patients, SA increased as a function of the slowing of group II CV. During a dynamic balance task the head A-P displacement was only slightly increased in the patient groups with respect to normals, despite the increased delay at which the head followed displacement of the feet. The unpredictably good performance of all patient groups under dynamic condition, which was at variance with their imbalance during quiet stance, may indicate that these patients learnt to exploit anticipatory postural strategies. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Resonance can occur in bistable dynamical systems due to the interplay between noise and delay ($\tau$) in the absence of a periodic input. We investigate resonance in a two-neuron model with mutual time-delayed inhibitory feedback. For appropriate choices of the parameters and inputs three fixed-point attractors co-exist: two are stable and one is unstable. In the absence of noise, delay-induced transient oscillations (referred to herein as DITOs) arise whenever the initial function is tuned sufficiently close to the unstable fixed-point. In the presence of noisy perturbations, DITOs arise spontaneously. Since the correlation time for the stationary dynamics is ∼$\tau$, we approximated a higher order Markov process by a three-state Markov chain model by rescaling time as t → 2s$\tau$, identifying the states based on whether the sub-intervals were completely confined to one basin of attraction (the two stable attractors) or straddled the separatrix, and then determining the transition probability matrix empirically. The resultant Markov chain model captured the switching behaviors including the statistical properties of the DITOs. Our observations indicate that time-delayed and noisy bistable dynamical systems are prone to generate DITOs as switches between the two attractors occur. Bistable systems arise transiently in situations when one attractor is gradually replaced by another. This may explain, for example, why seizures in certain epileptic syndromes tend to occur as sleep stages change.},

All are fairly reproducible and have been applied successfully in monitoring neurogenic disease progression. Quantitating the number of lower motor neurons is important, since the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and strength may not change as rapidly over time due to the confounding effect of reinnervation. MUNE techniques differ in the way they obtain samples of surface-recorded motor unit potentials (SMUP). Statistical MUNE is based on Poisson statistics, uses surface stimulation, and is useful in testing distal, superficial nerves. This review focuses on the theory behind the development of the technique, critiques the publications resulting from applying the technique in control and disease subjects, and discusses the future developments needed for clinical utility.},

Experimental data from patients and animal models of spasticity as well as computer simulations are evaluated.The current clinical methods used for the management of spasticity and the pharmacological actions of drugs are discussed in relation to their effects on spinal mechanisms. Critical assessment of experimental findings indicates that increased excitability of both motoneurons and interneurons plays a crucial role in pathophysiology of spasticity.

abstract = {HCN channels are responsible for I(h), a voltage-gated inwardly rectifying current activated by hyperpolarization. This current appears to be more active in human sensory axons than motor and may play a role in the determination of threshold. Differences in I(h) are likely to be responsible for the high variability in accommodation to hyperpolarization seen in different subjects. The aim of this study was to characterise this current in human axons, both motor and sensory. Recordings of multiple axonal excitability properties were performed in 10 subjects, with a focus on the changes in threshold evoked by longer and stronger hyperpolarizing currents than normally studied. The findings confirm that accommodation to hyperpolarization is greater in sensory than motor axons in all subjects, but the variability between subjects was greater than the modality difference. An existing model of motor axons was modified to take into account the behaviour seen with longer and stronger hyperpolarization, and a mathematical model of human sensory axons was developed based on the data collected. The differences in behaviour of sensory and motor axons and the differences between different subjects are best explained by modulation of the voltage dependence, along with a modest increase of expression of the underlying conductance of I(h). Accommodation to hyperpolarization for the mean sensory data is fitted well with a value of -94.2 mV for the mid-point of activation (V(0.5)) of I(h) as compared to -107.3 mV for the mean motor data. The variation in response to hyperpolarization between subjects is accounted for by varying this parameter for each modality (sensory: -89.2 to -104.2 mV; motor -87.3 to -127.3 mV). These voltage differences are within the range that has been described for physiological modulation of I(h) function. The presence of slowly activated I(h) isoforms on both motor and sensory axons was suggested by modelling a large internodal leak current and a masking of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump activity by a tonic depolarization. In addition to an increased activation of I(h), the modelling suggests that in sensory axons the nodal slow K(+) conductance is reduced, with consequent depolarization of resting membrane potential, and action potential of shorter duration.},

abstract = {Objectives: To compare the gait pattern in patients affected by different types of neuropathy. Methods: We recruited healthy subjects (HS, n=38), patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) (n=10) and patients with diabetic neuropathy (DNP) (n=12). Neuropathy impairment score and neuropathy score were assessed. Body sway during quiet stance, and spatio-temporal gait parameters were recorded. Results: Most patients had reduced or absent tendon-tap reflexes. Strength of foot dorsiflexor muscles (p<. 0.05) and conduction velocity (CV) of leg nerves (p<. 0.0001) were more impaired in CMT1A than DNP, whereas joint-position sense was more affected (p<. 0.05) in DNP. Body sway while standing was larger in DNP compared to CMT1A and HS (p<. 0.01 and p<. 0.0001 respectively). During gait, the distribution of foot sole contact pressure was abnormal in CMT1A (p<. 0.05) but not in DNP. Velocity and step length were decreased, and foot yaw angle at foot flat increased, in DNP with respect to CMT1A and HS (both variables, p<. 0.001). Gait velocity and step length were decreased (p<. 0.005) also in CMT1A, but to a smaller extent than in DNP, so that the difference between patient groups was significant (p<. 0.0005). Duration of the double support was protracted in DNP compared to CMT1A and HS (p<. 0.0005). For DNP only, velocity of gait and duration of single support were correlated (p<. 0.05) both to sway path and lower limb muscle strength. Conclusions: Changes in both body sway and stance phase of gait were larger in DNP than CMT1A, indicating more impaired static and dynamic control of balance when neuropathy affects the small in addition to the large afferent fibres. Diminished somatosensory input from the smaller fibres rather than muscle weakness or foot deformity plays a critical role in the modulation of the support phase of gait. Significance: The analysis of balance and gait in patients with neuropathy can offer a tool for understanding the nature and functional impact of the neuropathy and should be included in their functional evaluation. ?? 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

We examined coherence between single-unit discharge in somatosensory/parietal areas and local field potential from the same area as the unit, or from the motor cortex, in two macaque monkeys trained to perform a finger movement task. There were clear coherence peaks at approximately 17.5 Hz for cells in the primary somatosensory cortex (both proprioceptive and cutaneous areas) and posterior parietal cortex (area 5). The size of coherence in all areas was comparable to previous reports analysing motor cortical cells and M1 field potentials. Many coherence phases clustered around -pi/2 radians, indicating zero lag synchronization of parietal cells with M1 oscillatory activity. These results indicate that cells in somatosensory and parietal areas have information about the presence of oscillations in the motor system. Such oscillatory coupling across the central sulcus may play an important role in sensorimotor integration of both proprioceptive and cutaneous signals.},

Mice deficient in APP and its homolog APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) exhibit aberrant apposition of presynaptic marker proteins with postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and excessive nerve terminal sprouting. The number of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals is dramatically reduced. These structural abnormalities are accompanied by defective neurotransmitter release and a high incidence of synaptic failure.

abstract = {A description is provided of the fiber-type composition of several hindlimb muscles of the adult turtle, Pseudemys (Trachemys) scripta elegans. In addition, cross-section areas of each fiber type and an estimation of the relative (weighted) cross-section area (wCSA) occupied by the different fiber types are also provided. Seven muscles were selected for study, based on their suitability for future neurophysiological analysis as components of the segmental motor system, and on their homologies with muscles in other vertebrates. The test muscles were iliofibularis (ILF), ambiens (AMB), external gastrocnemius (EG), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), flexor digitorum longus (FDL), tibialis anterior (TA), and peroneus anterior (PA). Serial sections of these muscles were stained for myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), NADH-diaphorase, and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH), thereby enabling fiber-type classification on the basis of indirect markers for contraction speed and oxidative (aerobic) vs. glycolytic (anaerobic) metabolism. All muscles contained three fiber types: slow oxidative (SO; possibly including some non-twitch tonic fibers); fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG); and fast glycolytic (Fg). There were at least 30{\%} FOG and 50{\%} FOG + Fg fibers in the seven muscles, the extreme distributions being the predominantly glycolytic ILF vs. the predominantly oxidative FDL muscle (ILF-15.5{\%} SO, 35.2{\%} FOG, 49.3{\%} Fg vs. FDL-49.1{\%} SO, 41.1{\%} FOG, 9.8{\%} Fg). As in other species, the test muscles exhibited varying degrees of regional concentration (compartmentalization) of the different fiber types. This feature was most striking in ILF. Pronounced compartmentalization was also observed in AMB, EG, PA, TA, and EDC, whereas the distribution of fiber types in the highly oxidative FDL was homogeneous. In five of the seven muscles, fiber size was ranked with Fg > FOG > SO. In terms of wCSA, which provides a coarse-grain measure of the different fiber types' potential contribution to whole muscle peak force, all muscles exhibited a higher Fg and lower SO contribution to cross-section area than suggested by their corresponding fiber-type composition. The largest relative increases in wCSA vs. fiber-type composition were in the ILF and AMB muscles. We conclude that the turtle hindlimb provides some interesting possibilities for testing for a division of labor among different muscles during different movements (e.g., sustained vs. ballistic), and for study of the behavior of the different fiber (and motor unit) types under normal and perturbed conditions. The relationships between the present results and previous findings on homologous muscles of the mammalian (cat, rat) and reptilian (lizard) hindlimb are discussed. (c) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {When using muscles, the precision with which force is delivered is as important as the delivery of force itself. Force is regulated by both the number of recruited motoneurons and their spike frequency. While it is known that the recruitment is ordered to reduce variability in force, it remains unclear whether the motoneuron gain, i.e., the slope of the transformation between synaptic input and spiking output, is also modulated to reduce variability in force. To address this issue, we use turtle hindlimb scratching as a model for fine motor control, since this behavior involves precise limb movement to rub the location of somatic nuisance touch. We recorded intracellularly from motoneurons in a reduced preparation where the limbs were removed to increase mechanical stability and the motor nerve activity served as a surrogate for muscle force. We found that not only is the gain of motoneurons regulated on a subsecond timescale, it is also adjusted to minimize variability. The modulation is likely achieved via an expansive nonlinearity between spike rate and membrane potential with inhibition having a divisive influence. These findings reveal a versatile mechanism of modulating neuronal sensitivity and suggest that such modulation is fundamentally linked to optimization.},

abstract = {Simulation of dendritic Ca(V)1.3 channels in cat lumbar motoneurons: spatial distribution. J Neurophysiol 94: 3961-3974, 2005. First published August 24, 2005; doi: 10.1152/jn.00391.2005. We used computer simulations to study the dendritic spatial distribution of low voltage-activated L-type calcium (Ca(V)1.3 type) channels, which mediate hysteretic persistent inward current (PIC) in spinal motoneurons. This study was prompted by the growing experimental evidence of the functional interactions between synaptic inputs and active conductances over the motoneuron dendritic tree. A compartmental cable model of an adult cat alpha-motoneuron was developed in NEURON simulation environment constituting the detailed morphology of type-identified triceps surae alpha-motoneuron and realistic distribution of group Ia afferent-to-motoneuron contacts. Simulations of different distributions of Ca(V)1.3 channels were conducted and the resultant behavior was compared to experimental data. Our results suggest that Ca(V)1.3 channels do not uniformly cover the whole motoneuron dendritic tree. Instead, their distribution is similar to that of synaptic contacts. We found that Ca(V)1.3 channels are primarily localized to a wide intermediate band overlapping with the dendritic Ia-synaptic territory at dendritic distances of 300 to 850 mu m (0.62 +/- 0.21 lambda) from the soma in triceps surae alpha-motoneurons. These findings explain the functional interaction between synaptic inputs and the Ca(V)1.3 channels over the motoneuron dendritic tree.},

abstract = {With aging, motoneurons and muscle tissue undergo significant changes, which influence function in terms of strength, mobility, and overall independence. Mathematical modeling provides a practical method of studying the relationships among recruitment, rate-coding, and force output in motor units, and may be used to predict functional neuromuscular changes related to aging. For this study, the Heckman-Binder model was used to examine changes in human quadriceps motor units. Relationships among current input, firing frequency, and force output were defined for both a younger and an older individual. Included in the model were age-related effects associated with reduced muscle contractile speed; reduced muscle-fibre number, size, and specific tension; reduced gain of the frequency-current relationship; decreased size of motoneurons; and altered motor unit remodeling. Adjustment of this model to reflect age-related changes resulted in a leftward shift of the force-frequency function, lower firing frequency for any given current injected into the motoneuron, and a reduction in maximal force output. The model suggests that older individuals are capable of reaching force levels up to approximately 50{\%} of those attained by younger individuals, with relatively similar or even slightly lower levels of current input. This could mean that the sense of effort and the contribution of factors other than degree of effort from afferent inputs to the pool, including conscious supraspinal centres, might be different in the older adult.},

abstract = {The present work investigated the control of upright posture on inclined surfaces (14 degrees). Such conditions could, for example, change the contributions of muscle spindles resulting in alterations in postural sway. Subjects stood in quiet stance over a force platform positioned in one of three different fixed positions: horizontal (H), toes-up (ankle dorsi-flexion, D) and toes-down (ankle plantar-flexion, P). The experiments were done in the presence and also in the absence of vision. The analysis of the resulting sway was based on the power spectrum of the center of pressure displacement in the anterior-posterior direction (CP{\_}ap). Analysis of the electromyogram (EMG) of the leg muscles and evaluation of the level of presynaptic inhibition (PSI) of the soleus (SO) Ia afferents complemented the study. The results showed that the spectrum of the CP{\_}ap changed with the inclination of the surface of support. In condition D a higher instability was found as reflected by the higher spectral amplitudes at lower frequencies (below 0.3 Hz). On the other hand, the CP{\_}ap of subjects in condition P contained increased amplitudes at high frequencies (above 0.3 Hz) and smaller amplitudes at low frequencies. The modifications found in the CP{\_}ap power spectra when standing over an inclined surface may indicate changes in both short-term and long-term systems of postural control. These results do not seem to be associated with changes in group Ia feedback gain since no changes in the level of PSI were found among the three standing conditions. The SO EMG increased in condition P but did not change in condition D. On the other hand, the tibialis anterior had a tendency towards increased bursting activity in condition D. Eye closure caused an increase in the power of the oscillations at all spectral frequencies in the three standing conditions (H, P or D) and also a change in the profile of the CP{\_}ap power spectrum. This may suggest a nonlinearity in the postural control system. The control of the slow component of the postural sway was more dependent on vision when the subject was in condition D, probably in association with the biomechanical constraints of standing on a toes-up ramp. A conclusion of this work was that, depending on the postural demand (direction of the ramp of support), the ensuing proprioceptive and biomechanical changes affect differentially the fast and slow mechanisms of balance control.},

abstract = {To keep balance when standing or walking on a surface inclined in the roll plane, the cat modifies its body configuration so that the functional length of its right and left limbs becomes different. The aim of the present study was to assess the motor cortex participation in the generation of this left/right asymmetry. We recorded the activity of fore- and hindlimb-related pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) during standing and walking on a treadmill. A difference in PTN activity at two tilted positions of the treadmill (+/- 15 deg) was considered a positional response to surface inclination. During standing, 47{\%} of PTNs exhibited a positional response, increasing their activity with either the contra-tilt (20{\%}) or the ipsi-tilt (27{\%}). During walking, PTNs were modulated in the rhythm of stepping, and tilts of the supporting surface evoked positional responses in the form of changes to the magnitude of modulation in 58{\%} of PTNs. The contra-tilt increased activity in 28{\%} of PTNs, and ipsi-tilt increased activity in 30{\%} of PTNs. We suggest that PTNs with positional responses contribute to the modifications of limb configuration that are necessary for adaptation to the inclined surface. By comparing the responses to tilts in individual PTNs during standing and walking, four groups of PTNs were revealed: responding in both tasks (30{\%}); responding only during standing (16{\%}); responding only during walking (30{\%}); responding in none of the tasks (24{\%}). This diversity suggests that common and separate cortical mechanisms are used for postural adaptation to tilts during standing and walking.},

abstract = {Flexible and stable postural control requires adaptation to changing environmental conditions, a process which requires re-weighting of multisensory stimuli. Recent studies, as well as predictions from a computational model, have indicated a reciprocal re-weighting relationship between modalities when a sensory stimulus changes amplitude. As one modality is down-weighted, another is up-weighted to compensate (and vice versa). The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of intra- and inter-modality re-weighting process by examining postural responses to manipulation of proprioception and visual modalities simultaneously. Twenty-two young adults were placed in a visual cave and stood on a variable-pitch platform for thirteen trials of 250 s apiece. The platform was rotated at constant frequency of 0.4 Hz and amplitudes of 0.3 (low) or 1.5 (high) degrees. Platform amplitude was manipulated in two conditions: low-to-high or high-to-low. The visual stimulus was displayed at constant frequency of 0.35 Hz and amplitude of 0.08 degrees. The results showed both fast and slow changes in center of mass (CoM) response to the switch in platform amplitude. On both timescales, CoM response changed in a reciprocal manner relative to platform amplitude. When the platform amplitude increased (low-to-high condition), CoM response decreased relative to the platform and increased relative to the visual stimulus, indicating both intra-modality and inter-modality sensory re-weighting. In the high-to-low condition, however, there was no change in CoM response relative to visual stimulus, indicating that re-weighting may also be dependent on the absolute level of gain. Sway variability at frequencies other than the stimulus frequency also showed a reciprocal relationship with CoM gain relative to platform. Overall, these results indicate that dynamics of multisensory re-weighting is clearly more complicated than the schemes proposed by current adaptive models of human postural control.},

@article{Griffiths1991,
abstract = {1. The length of muscle fibres in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle of the anaesthetized cat was measured using ultrasound techniques. During the course of 'isometric' contractions, the muscle fibres shortened by stretching the compliant tendons, until the muscle fibres could no longer produce enough force to stretch the tendons further. At optimal muscle length (L(o)) the maximal shortening of muscle fibres was 28{\%}. 2. At muscle lengths much longer than L(o), 'isometric' contractions produced a slow shortening of the muscle fibres as the tendons were stretched and this resulted in a slow rise in tension. This phenomenon, usually referred to as 'creep', is due to low power at long muscle fibre length. This study shows that the series compliance present in the tendons is the major contributor to 'creep' in the cat MG muscle. As the tendons stretched during the course of the contraction, the average sarcomere length became shorter providing greater filament overlap and increasing power. 3. Slow to medium speed stretches applied shortly after the onset of contraction, as occurs in cat MG during walking and trotting, were entirely taken up in the tendons and the muscle fibres actually shortened throughout the imposed muscle stretch. 4. When early stretches were applied at muscle lengths longer than L(o), stretch of the muscle resulted in a peak force that was less than if the stretch had not been applied. This was the reverse of the situation for stretches at lengths less than L(o). When stretch was applied after attaining peak force, the force was greatly enhanced and the muscle fibres were also stretched. 5. Using the same techniques in a freely walking cat, the muscle fibres shortened by 1.0 +/- 0.3 mm during the stance phase of the step-cycle when the muscle was being stretched, in 198 consecutive step-cycles. 6. The tendons act as a mechanical buffer to protect muscle fibres from damage during eccentric contractions. 7. Since stretches of the MG muscle are not faithfully imposed on the muscle fibres, studies of muscle spindle function during locomotion need to take into consideration these effects of tendon compliance. The dominant view, when the foot lands on the ground during normal locomotion, is that muscle spindles are stretched along with the muscle resulting in reflex enhancement of contractile force. This study shows that the muscle fibres do not stretch under these circumstances, except at high speeds of locomotion when the stretch rate is also high.},

abstract = {Motor unit (MU) potentials were registered from 20 ALS patients and 13 age-matched control individuals during isometric constant force contractions of brachial biceps (BB). The registered signals were decomposed into single MU potential trains. The estimates of duration of the afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) in MNs, derived from the interspike interval variability, was compared between ALS patients (124 MNs) and control subjects (111 MNs) and no significant differences were encountered. However, the relationship between TI and age for patients appeared to be qualitatively different from that of the control group. The dependence of patients' AHPs on relative force deficit (RFD), which quantified muscle involvement, was more specific. For RFDs below 30{\%}, the AHP estimate was significantly lower than control values and then increased thereafter with increasing RFDs. Moreover, firing rates of patients with the smallest RFDs were significantly higher while firing rates of patients with the greatest RFDs were significantly lower than control values. The AHP shortening in the early stages of muscle impairment is consistent with the decrease in firing threshold of ‘fast' MNs found in spinal cord slices from neonatal SOD1 mice. The later elongation of the AHP may be caused by the higher vulnerability of ‘fast' MNs to degeneration and by the influence of reinnervation. Our results are comparable to what has been observed in acute experiments in animal models, providing a bridge between animal and clinical research that may be relevant for identification of mechanism(s) underlying neurodegeneration in ALS.},

abstract = {To quantify the contribution of sensory information to multisegmental frontal plane balance control in humans, we developed a feedback control model to account for experimental data. Subjects stood with feet close together on a surface that rotated according to a pseudorandom waveform at three different amplitudes. Experimental frequency-response functions and impulse-response functions were measured to characterize lower body (LB) and upper body (UB) motion evoked during surface rotations while subjects stood with eyes open or closed. The model assumed that corrective torques in LB and UB segments were generated with no time delay from intrinsic musculoskeletal mechanisms and with time delay from sensory feedback mechanisms. It was found that subjects' LB control was primarily based on sensory feedback. Changes in the LB control mechanisms across stimulus amplitude were consistent with the hypothesis that sensory reweighting contributed to amplitude-dependent changes in balance responses whereby subjects decreased reliance on proprioceptive cues that oriented the LB toward the surface and increased reliance on vestibular/visual cues that oriented the LB upright toward earth vertical as stimulus amplitude increased in both eyes open and closed conditions. Sensory reweighting in the LB control system also accounted for most of the amplitude-dependent changes observed in UB responses. In contrast to the LB system, sensory reweighting was not a dominant mechanism of UB control, and UB control was more influenced by intrinsic musculoskeletal mechanisms. The proposed model refines our understanding of sensorimotor integration during balance control by including multisegmental motion and explaining how intersegmental interactions influence frontal plane balance responses.},

abstract = {The probability density function (PDF) of the surface electromyogram (EMG) signals has been modelled with Gaussian and Laplacian distribution functions. However, a general consensus upon the PDF of the EMG signals is yet to be reached, because not only are there several biological factors that can influence this distribution function, but also different analysis techniques can lead to contradicting results. Here, we recorded the EMG signal at different isometric muscle contraction levels and characterised the probability distribution of the surface EMG signal with two statistical measures: bicoherence and kurtosis. Bicoherence analysis did not help to infer the PDF of measured EMG signals. In contrast, with kurtosis analysis we demonstrated that the EMG PDF at isometric, non-fatiguing, low contraction levels is super-Gaussian. Moreover, kurtosis analysis showed that as the contraction force increases the surface EMG PDF tends to a Gaussian distribution.},

abstract = {The control of upper body (UB) orientation relative to the pelvis in the frontal plane was characterized in bilateral vestibular loss subjects (BVLs) and compared with healthy control subjects (Cs). UB responses to external perturbations were evoked using continuous pelvis tilts (eyes open and eyes closed) at various amplitudes. Lateral sway of the lower body was prevented on all tests. UB sway was summarized using root-mean-square measures and dynamic behavior was characterized using frequency response functions (FRFs) from 0.023 to 10.3 Hz. Both subject groups had similar FRF variations as a function of stimulus frequency and were relatively unaffected by visual availability, indicating that visual orientation cues contributed very little to UB control. BVLs had larger UB sway at frequencies below approximately 1 Hz compared with Cs. A feedback model of UB orientation control was used to identify sensory contributions to spinal stability and differences between subject groups. The model-based interpretation of experimental results indicated that a phasic proprioceptive signal encoding the angular velocity of UB relative to lower body motion was a major contributor to overall system damping. Parametric system identification showed that BVLs used proprioceptive information that oriented the UB toward the pelvis to a greater extent compared with Cs. Both subject groups used sensory information that oriented the UB vertical in space to a greater extent as pelvis tilt amplitudes increased. In BVLs, proprioceptive information signaling the UB orientation relative to the fixed lower body provided the vertical reference, whereas in Cs, vestibular information also contributed to the vertical reference.},

abstract = {Upright stance in humans is inherently unstable, requiring corrective action based on spatial-orientation information from sensory systems. One might logically predict that environments providing access to accurate orientation information from multiple sensory systems would facilitate postural stability. However, we show that, after a period in which access to accurate sensory information was reduced, the restoration of accurate information disrupted postural stability. In eyes-closed trials, proprioceptive information was altered by rotating the support surface in proportion to body sway (support surface "sway-referencing"). When the support surface returned to a level orientation, most subjects developed a transient 1-Hz body sway oscillation that differed significantly from the low-amplitude body sway typically observed during quiet stance. Additional experiments showed further enhancement of the 1-Hz oscillation when the surface transitioned from a sway-referenced to a reverse sway-referenced motion. Oscillatory behavior declined with repetition of trials, suggesting a learning effect. A simple negative feedback-control model of the postural control system predicted the occurrence of this 1-Hz oscillation in conditions where too much corrective torque is generated in proportion to body sway. Model simulations were used to distinguish between two alternative explanations for the excessive corrective torque generation. Simulation results favor an explanation based on the dynamic reweighting of sensory contributions to postural control rather than a load-compensation mechanism that scales torque in proportion to a fixed combination of sensory-orientation information.},

abstract = {Purpose. Tendons behave viscoelastically and exhibit adaptive responses to conditions of increased loading and disuse. Strain patterns in tendons may not be uniform, as tendons show stress-shielded areas and areas subjected to compressive loading at the enthesis. These areas correspond to the sites where tendinopathic characteristics are typically seen. Method. We review the biomechanic literature on Achilles tendon, trying to interpret it on the basis that classic inflammatory changes are not frequently seen in chronic athletic tendon conditions. Results. Biomechanical studies show that the strains within the tendons near their insertion site are not uniform. If the material properties are similar throughout the tendon, forces transferred through the insertion site preferentially load the side of the tendon that is usually not affected initially in tendinopathy. In that case, the side affected by tendinopathy is generally 'stress shielded'. Conclusion. The presence of differential strains opens the possibility of alternative biomechanical explanations for the pathology found in these regions of the tendon. The traditional concept of tensile failure may not be the essential feature of the pathomechanics of insertional tendinopathy. Additional work is needed ascertain whether such principles should be incorporated in current rehabilitation.},

abstract = {In this report a new technique of recording, employed for the first time in routine clinical electromyography (EMG) is described. Conventional analysis is extended to the order of recruitment pattern, and relates the new electrophysiological features to current data about anatomical reorganization of all active motor units (MUs) and their functional effectiveness in neuromuscular disorders. This new concept was tested in four groups of patients (two different myopathic disorders), and (two neuropathies), which were compared to normal subjects. The data obtained confirmed that in normal subjects isometric muscle contraction from weak to maximal effort, was characterized by recruitment of MUs in an orderly pattern according to the "size principle". In polymyositis patients representing the myopathy model a nearly normal range of functioning MUs was found, but their sizes were reduced to a greater extent in the low threshold population. Irrespective of their increased firing rate and variability, the orderly recruitment pattern was still maintained. A different picture was seen in patients with Duchenne dystrophy where the range of functioning MUs and their sizes were reduced with the characteristic lack of high amplitude MUs, (probably high threshold). In the neurogenic groups the range of functioning MUs was reduced but increased in size, and the pattern of recruitment evidently became disorderly. We also found a difference in the manner of disorderly recruitment between motor neuron range disease (MND) and polyneuropathy patients. In the MND group the surviving MUs create very narrow and probably only high threshold MUs with a tendency to their synchronization seen evidently during maximal effort. In the peripheral neuropathy group, the functioning MUs represented wider range of very different sizes, and they were often recruited asynchronously during maximal effort, giving lower amplitudes and rather higher density of record not proportional to the number of MUs lost.},

abstract = {Human nerve fibers exhibit a distinct pattern of threshold fluctuation following a single action potential known as the recovery cycle. We developed geometrically and electrically accurate models of mammalian motor nerve fibers to gain insight into the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the changes in axonal excitability and regulate the recovery cycle. The models developed in this study incorporated a double cable structure, with explicit representation of the nodes of Ranvier, paranodal, and internodal sections of the axon as well as a finite impedance myelin sheath. These models were able to reproduce a wide range of experimental data on the excitation properties of mammalian myelinated nerve fibers. The combination of an accurate representation of the ion channels at the node (based on experimental studies of human, cat, and rat) and matching the geometry of the paranode, internode, and myelin to measured morphology (necessitating the double cable representation) were needed to match the model behavior to the experimental data. Following an action potential, the models generated both depolarizing (DAP) and hyperpolarizing (AHP) afterpotentials. The model results support the hypothesis that both active (persistent Na(+) channel activation) and passive (discharging of the internodal axolemma through the paranodal seal) mechanisms contributed to the DAP, while the AHP was generated solely through active (slow K(+) channel activation) mechanisms. The recovery cycle of the fiber was dependent on the DAP and AHP, as well as the time constant of activation and inactivation of the fast Na(+) conductance. We propose that experimentally documented differences in the action potential shape, strength-duration relationship, and the recovery cycle of motor and sensory nerve fibers can be attributed to kinetic differences in their nodal Na(+) conductances.},

abstract = {To examine neuromuscular partitioning within human muscles, the innervation patterns and muscle fiber architecture of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles were examined. Consistent patterns of innervation between specimens were found within each of the three muscles. The nerve to the FCR clearly innervates three major architectural divisions of the muscle. The ECRL is innervated by two different muscle nerves. Branches of these nerves innervate at least two distinct anatomical subvolumes. However, the subvolumes of the ECRL defined by muscle architecture are not totally congruent with those defined by the innervation pattern. In the LG, the single muscle nerve branches into two main divisions, and these subsequently divide into branches which supply the three heads. However, each head does not receive a completely private nerve. These results indicate that human muscles are partitioned in a manner roughly similar to the divisions of the same muscles in cats and rats, but with less congruency of architecture and innervation.},

abstract = {Neural oscillations in the beta band (15-30 Hz) occur coherently throughout the primate somatomotor network, comprising somatomotor cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord, with the latter resulting in beta oscillations in muscular activity. In accordance with the anatomy of this network, these oscillations have traditionally been associated strictly with motor function. Here we show in humans that somatosensory demands, both in anticipation and during the processing of tactile stimuli, also modulate beta oscillations throughout this network. Specifically, somatosensory demands suppress the degree to which not only cortical activity but also muscular activity oscillates in the beta band. This suppression of muscular beta oscillations by perceptual demands is specific to demands in the somatosensory modality and occurs independent of movement preparation and execution: it occurs even when no movement is required at all. This places touch perception as an important computation within this widely distributed somatomotor beta network and suggests that, at least in healthy subjects, somatosensation and action should not be considered as separable processes, not even at the level of the muscles.},

abstract = {1. Changing the posture of the human fingers can functionally 'disengage' the deep finger flexor muscle from its normal action on the terminal phalanx of the fourth (or third) finger. This enables the activity of the muscle to be studied both with and without its normal proprioceptive inputs. 2. Spike trains of long duration from pairs of concurrently active motor units in this muscle were recorded in both the engaged and disengaged hand postures. Subjects voluntarily kept one of the motor units (the 'controlled' unit) discharging at the same target frequency in both postures. The strength of short-term synchrony, the strength of common drive, and the variability of discharge of these pairs of motor units were determined in both postures. 3. All subjects reported that the effort required to activate the motor units in the disengaged hand posture was substantially greater than in the normal engaged posture. 4. Short-term synchrony, which is a function of common corticospinal inputs to pairs of motor units, was similar in both hand postures. However, the strength of common drive was significantly decreased when the muscle was disengaged. Although the neural substrate for common drive is not known, this observation suggests that proprioceptive feedback is involved either directly or indirectly. 5. Although the discharge rate of the 'uncontrolled' motor units increased when the muscle was disengaged, the variability of discharge of these and the 'controlled' motor units increased significantly. This supports the idea that the precision with which fine motor tasks can be performed is improved when proprioceptive feedback is intact.},

abstract = {Objectives: To study the correlation between anatomical parameters and EMG signals by means of simulations. Methods: A mathematical model of the electrical activity from muscle fibres and motor units has been developed. The electrical fields around the muscle fibres are simulated using a line source model. The model permits the simulation of single muscle fibre action potentials obtained by SFEMG, concentric and Macro EMG electrodes. By using appropriate anatomical parameters EMG recordings with these electrodes can be simulated. The model is flexible and permits a number of anatomical parameters to be changed such as; number of muscle fibres in a motor unit, fibre diameter distribution, and motor end-plate geometry. Some physiological parameters can be optionally varied; firing rate, threshold for recruitment, jitter. Results: In this study, simulations of CNEMG are performed and the influence of a number of parameters on the CNEMG signal is studied. It is shown that the model produces motor unit potentials reasonably well resembling those from live recordings. Mon important is however the relative change in MUP parameters when certain conditions are changed; number of muscle fibres in a motor unit, recording position, muscle fibre diameters and some special effects of the recording conditions. Conclusions: The simulated muscle and corresponding EMG recording can be used both as a research tool and for teaching. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Within a motoneuron pool, recruitment and rate coding of individual motor units might be controlled independently, depending on the circumstances. In this study, we tested whether, during human quiet standing, the force of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle is predominantly controlled by recruitment or rate coding. If MG control during standing was mainly due to recruitment, then we further asked what the trigger mechanism is. Is it determined internally, or is it related to body kinematics? While seven healthy subjects stood quietly, intramuscular electromyograms were recorded from the MG muscle with three pairs of wire electrodes. The number of active motor units and their mean discharge rate were compared for different sway velocities and positions. Motor unit discharges occurred more frequently when the body swayed faster and forward (Pearson R = 0.63; P < 0.0001). This higher likelihood of observing motor unit potentials was explained chiefly by the recruitment of additional units. During forward body shifts, the median number of units detected increased from 3 to 11 (P < 0.0001), whereas the discharge rate changed from 8 ± 1.1 (mean ± SD) to 10 ± 0.9 pulses/s (P = 0.001). Strikingly, motor units did not discharge continuously throughout standing. They were recruited within individual, forward sways and intermittently, with a modal rate of two recruitments per second. This modal rate is consistent with previous circumstantial evidence relating the control of standing to an intrinsic, higher level planning process.},

abstract = {Introduction: Brand's four reasons for clinical tests and his analysis of the characteristics of valid biomechanical tests for use in orthopaedics are taken as a basis for determining what methodologies are required for gait analysis in a clinical rehabilitation context. Measurement methods in clinical gait analysis: The state of the art of optical systems capable of measuring the positions of retro-reflective markers placed on the skin is sufficiently advanced that they are probably no longer a significant source of error in clinical gait analysis. Determining the anthropometry of the subject and compensating for soft tissue movement in relation to the under-lying bones are now the principal problems. Techniques for using functional tests to determine joint centres and axes of rotation are starting to be used successfully. Probably the last great challenge for optical systems is in using computational techniques to compensate for soft tissue measurements. In the long term future it is possible that direct imaging of bones and joints in three dimensions (using MRI or fluoroscopy) may replace marker based systems. Methods for interpreting gait analysis data: There is still not an accepted general theory of why we walk the way we do. In the absence of this, many explanations of walking address the mechanisms by which specific movements are achieved by particular muscles. A whole new methodology is developing to determine the functions of individual muscles. This needs further development and validation. A particular requirement is for subject specific models incorporating 3-dimensional imaging data of the musculo-skeletal anatomy with kinematic and kinetic data. Methods for understanding the effects of intervention: Clinical gait analysis is extremely limited if it does not allow clinicians to choose between alternative possible interventions or to predict outcomes. This can be achieved either by rigorously planned clinical trials or using theoretical models. The evidence base is generally poor partly because of the limited number of prospective clinical trials that have been completed and more such studies are essential. Very recent work has started to show the potential of using models of the mechanisms by which people with pathology walk in order to simulate different potential interventions. The development of these models offers considerable promise for new clinical applications of gait analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomedical research is changing due to the rapid accumulation of experimental data at an unprecedented scale, revealing increasing degrees of complexity of biological processes. Life Sciences are facing a transition from a descriptive to a mechanistic approach that reveals principles of cells, cellular networks, organs, and their interactions across several spatial and temporal scales. There are two conceptual traditions in biological computational-modeling. The bottom-up approach emphasizes complex intracellular molecular models and is well represented within the systems biology community. On the other hand, the physics-inspired top-down modeling strategy identifies and selects features of (presumably) essential relevance to the phenomena of interest and combines available data in models of modest complexity. RESULTS: The workshop, "ESF Exploratory Workshop on Computational disease Modeling", examined the challenges that computational modeling faces in contributing to the understanding and treatment of complex multi-factorial diseases. Participants at the meeting agreed on two general conclusions. First, we identified the critical importance of developing analytical tools for dealing with model and parameter uncertainty. Second, the development of predictive hierarchical models spanning several scales beyond intracellular molecular networks was identified as a major objective. This contrasts with the current focus within the systems biology community on complex molecular modeling. CONCLUSION: During the workshop it became obvious that diverse scientific modeling cultures (from computational neuroscience, theory, data-driven machine-learning approaches, agent-based modeling, network modeling and stochastic-molecular simulations) would benefit from intense cross-talk on shared theoretical issues in order to make progress on clinically relevant problems.},

abstract = {Convincing evidence suggests that long-latency reflexes (LLRs) are capable of testing the transcortical sensorimotor reflex arch. By subtracting the sum of the latencies of N20 (afferent branch) and transcranially elicited motor evoked potentials (MEP; efferent branch) from the LLR II latency, the cortical relay time (CRT) can also be obtained, which is alleged to represent the time required for the cortical sensorimotor integration. The aim of the present study was to investigate if a cortical dysfunction occurs in multiple sclerosis (MS). Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), MEPs and LLRs were recorded from the upper limbs of 23, not severely disabled MS patients in acute phases of the disease. Eighteen age and sex matched healthy volunteers served as controls. N20, MEP, LLR II latencies were measured, and the CRT was calculated for each limb. The statistical comparison between patients and controls was only weakly significant by taking into account conduction times along either the afferent (N20) or the efferent (MEP) pathways. On the contrary, it turned out to be considerably significant if both branches of the transcortical sensorimotor reflex arch, together with the intracortical pathway, were simultaneously tested by means of the LLRs. Moreover, the patients showed a significantly higher CRT compared with that found in the control subjects. These findings are consistent with a prolonged intracortical delay of LLRs in the MS group and suggest the occurrence of conduction velocity slowing and/or synaptic transmission impairment along the sensorimotor intracortical pathway in MS. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The T-wave of the patellar tendon reflex (PTR) was recorded in 24 neurologically normal dogs. The surface electromyogram (EMG) was recorded as the T-wave from the vastus lateralis muscle (VL) in response to percussion of the patellar tendon. The distance of the reflex arc (DRA) was measured along the straight line between the spinous process of L5 and the greater trochanter (GT), and between GT and the patellar ligament (PL). There was a significant correlation (P<0.001) of the latency with the DRA on each side, but no difference in the slopes of the relationships between right and left VL was shown. The regression line between the DRA and the latency of all data was Y = 0.0216X + 1.693, where Y = latency in ins, X = DRA in mm. The mixed sensory-motor conduction velocity was estimated as 84.6 +/- 5.5 m/s. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the DRA and the amplitude of the T-waves. The mean (mean-CV) and standard deviation (SD-CV) of all CV (coefficient of variation) in each dog were 9.14 +/- 3.65{\%} in latency and 3.54 +/- 1.14{\%} in amplitude, indicating that the use of a simple hand-held reflex hammer is sufficient to record the reproducible T-wave of the PTR even in unanesthetized dogs. This method was applied to a case with minimal paraparesis, and the latency of the T-wave of the PTR in the fight hind limb with slight proprioceptive deficit was outside of the upper limit of the 95{\%} confidence interval between latency and the DRA. In conclusion, this method may be used in neurological diagnosis to quantify more precisely the PTR in dogs.},

abstract = {The motor cortex assumes an increasingly important role in higher mammals relative to that in lower mammals. This is true to such an extent that the human motor cortex is deeply involved in reflex regulation and it is common to speak of "transcortical reflex loops." Such loops appear to add flexibility to the human stretch reflex, once considered to be immutable, allowing it to adapt across a range of functional tasks. However, the purpose of this adaptation remains unclear. A common proposal is that stretch reflexes contribute to the regulation of limb stability; increased reflex sensitivity during tasks performed in unstable environments supports this hypothesis. Alternatively, before movement onset, stretch reflexes can assist an imposed stretch, opposite to what would be expected from a stabilizing response. Here we show that stretch reflex modulation in tasks that require changes in limb stability is mediated by motor cortical pathways, and that these differ from pathways contributing to reflex modulation that depend on how the subject is instructed to react to an imposed perturbation. By timing muscle stretches such that the modulated portion of the reflex occurred within a cortical silent period induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation, we abolished the increase in reflex sensitivity observed when individuals stabilized arm posture within a compliant environment. Conversely, reflex modulation caused by altered task instruction was unaffected by cortical silence. These results demonstrate that task-dependent changes in reflex function can be mediated through multiple neural pathways and that these pathways have task-specific roles.},

@article{Jones2002,
abstract = {It has been proposed that the invariant kinematics observed during goal-directed movements result from reducing the consequences of signal-dependent noise (SDN) on motor output. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of SDN during isometric force production and determine how central and peripheral components contribute to this feature of motor control. Peripheral and central components were distinguished experimentally by comparing voluntary contractions to those elicited by electrical stimulation of the extensor pollicis longus muscle. To determine other factors of motor-unit physiology that may contribute to SDN, a model was constructed and its output compared with the empirical data. SDN was evident in voluntary isometric contractions as a linear scaling of force variability (SD) with respect to the mean force level. However, during electrically stimulated contractions to the same force levels, the variability remained constant over the same range of mean forces. When the subjects were asked to combine voluntary with stimulation-induced contractions, the linear scaling relationship between the SD and mean force returned. The modeling results highlight that much of the basic physiological organization of the motor-unit pool, such as range of twitch amplitudes and range of recruitment thresholds, biases force output to exhibit linearly scaled SDN. This is in contrast to the square root scaling of variability with mean force present in any individual motor-unit of the pool. Orderly recruitment by twitch amplitude was a necessary condition for producing linearly scaled SDN. Surprisingly, the scaling of SDN was independent of the variability of motoneuron firing and therefore by inference, independent of presynaptic noise in the motor command. We conclude that the linear scaling of SDN during voluntary isometric contractions is a natural by-product of the organization of the motor-unit pool that does not depend on signal-dependent noise in the motor command. Synaptic noise in the motor command and common drive, which give rise to the variability and synchronization of motoneuron spiking, determine the magnitude of the force variability at a given level of mean force output.},

abstract = {Sensorimotor EEG shows approximately 20 Hz coherence with contralateral EMG. This could involve efferent and/or afferent components of the sensorimotor loop. We investigated the pathways responsible for coherence genesis by manipulating nervous conduction delays using cooling. Coherence between left sensorimotor EEG and right EMG from three hand and two forearm muscles was assessed in healthy subjects during the hold phase of a precision grip task. The right arm was then cooled to 10 degrees C for approximately 90 min, increasing peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT) by approximately 35{\%} (assessed by F-wave latency). EEG and EMG recordings were repeated, and coherence recalculated. Control recordings revealed a heterogeneous subject population. In 6/15 subjects (Group A), the corticomuscular coherence phase increased linearly with frequency, as expected if oscillations were propagated along efferent pathways from cortex to muscle. The mean corticomuscular conduction delay for intrinsic hand muscles calculated from the phase-frequency regression slope was 10.4 ms; this is smaller than the delay expected for conduction over fast corticospinal pathways. In 8/15 subjects (Group B), the phase showed no dependence with frequency. One subject showed both Group A and Group B patterns over different frequency ranges. Following cooling, averaged corticomuscular coherence was decreased in Group A subjects, but unchanged for Group B, even though both groups showed comparable slowing of nervous conduction. The delay calculated from the slope of the phase-frequency regression was increased following cooling. However, the size of this increase was around twice the rise in PMCT measured using the F-wave (regression slope 2.33, 95{\%} confidence limits 1.30-3.36). Both afferent and efferent peripheral nerves will be slowed by similar amounts following cooling. The change in delay calculated from the coherence phase therefore better matches the rise in total sensorimotor feedback loop time caused by cooling, rather than just the change in the efferent limb. A model of corticomuscular coherence which assumes that only efferent pathways contribute cannot be reconciled to these results. The data rather suggest that afferent feedback pathways may also play a role in the genesis of corticomuscular coherence.},

abstract = {Objective: Motor unit action potential (MUAP) recordings are modeled by means of a single muscle fiber simulation program, to define two key subcomponents comprising the complete physiologic MUAP duration. A number of defining properties of these subcomponents are further developed. Methods: A single muscle fiber simulation program is utilized with various muscle fiber lengths and conduction velocities to generate near-field and far-field waveforms. Results. Two key subcomponents to the total physiologic single muscle fiber and hence MUAP duration are identified. One, defined as the near-field component, is directly dependent upon muscle fiber hemi-length. The other, defined as the far-field component, is independent of fiber length, but matches the internal action potential in duration. Both the near-field and far-field components are inversely dependent upon intracellular action potential conduction velocity. Additionally, temporal dispersion among the individual fibers contributing to a MUAP must be included in the overall MUAP duration calculation. Conclusions: It is hoped that this approach to MUAP duration may allow a more complete appreciation of the components contributing to the MUAP, than permitted by the empirically derived values for MUAP duration presently under clinical use.

First published October 1, 2009; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00464.2009.-Mean maximal motor unit firing rates (MUFRs) of the human soleus are lower (5-20 Hz) than other limb muscles (20-50 Hz) during brief sustained contractions. With healthy adult aging, maximal MUFRs are 20-40{\{}{\%}{\}} lower and twitch contractile speed of lower limb muscles are 10-40{\{}{\%}{\}} slower compared with young adults. However, it is unknown whether the inherently low maximal MUFRs for the soleus are further reduced with aging in association with age-related slowing in contractile properties. The purpose of the present study was to compare the changes in triceps surae contractile properties and MUFRs of the soleus throughout a variety of contraction intensities in six old (similar to 75 yr old) and six young (similar to 24 yr old) men. Neuromuscular measures were collected from the soleus and triceps surae during repeated sessions (2-6 sessions). Populations of single MUFR trains were recorded from the soleus with tungsten microelectrodes during separate sustained 6- to 10-s isometric contractions of varying intensities [25{\{}{\%}{\}}, 50{\{}{\%}{\}}, 75{\{}{\%}{\}}, and 100{\{}{\%}{\}} maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC)]. The old men had weaker triceps surae strength (MVC; 35{\{}{\%}{\}} lower) and slower contractile properties (contraction duration; 20{\{}{\%}{\}} longer) than the young men. However, there was no difference in average MUFRs of the soleus at 75{\{}{\%}{\}} and 100{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC (similar to 14.5 Hz and similar to 16.5 Hz, respectively). At 25{\{}{\%}{\}} and 50{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC, average rates were 10{\{}{\%}{\}} and 20{\{}{\%}{\}} lower in the old men compared with young, respectively. Despite a significant slowing in triceps surae contraction duration, there was no age-related change in MUFRs recorded at high contractile intensities in the soleus. Thus the relationship between the whole muscle contractile properties and MUFRs found in other muscle groups may not exist between the triceps surae and soleus and may be muscle dependent.},

In the present study, another way to approach mechanical behaviour of a musculo-articular structure was used, i.e. sinusoidal oscillations during sub-maximal contractions. This led to the expression of (i). Bode diagrams allowing the determination of a damping coefficient (B(bode)); and (ii). a viscous parameter (B(sin)) using an adaptation of Hill's equation to sinusoidal oscillations. Then torque-angular velocity relationships were predicted from a model based on the interrelation between B(bode) and B(sin) and on the determination of optimal conditions of contraction. This offers the possibility of characterizing muscle dynamic properties by avoiding the use of isokinetic maximal contractions.},

abstract = {Voltage-dependent calcium and sodium channels mediating persistent inward currents (PICs) amplify the effects of synaptic inputs on the membrane potential and firing rate of motoneurons. CaPIC channels are thought to be relatively slow, whereas the NaPIC channels have fast kinetics. These different characteristics influence how synaptic inputs with different frequency content are amplified; the slow kinetics of Ca channels suggest that they can only contribute to amplification of low frequency inputs (<5 Hz). To characterize frequency-dependent amplification of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), we measured the averaged stretch-evoked EPSPs in cat medial gastrocnemius motoneurons in decerebrate cats at different subthreshold levels of membrane potential. EPSPs were produced by muscle spindle afferents activated by stretching the homonymous and synergist muscles at frequencies of 5-50 Hz. We adjusted the stretch amplitudes at different frequencies to produce approximately the same peak-to-peak EPSP amplitude and quantified the amount of amplification by expressing the EPSP integral at different levels of depolarization as a percentage of that measured with the membrane hyperpolarized. Amplification was observed at all stretch frequencies but generally decreased with increasing stretch frequency. However, in many cells the amount of amplification was greater at 10 Hz than at 5 Hz. Fast amplification was generally reduced or absent when the lidocaine derivative QX-314 was included in the electrode solution, supporting a strong contribution from Na channels. These results suggest that NaPICs can combine with CaPICs to enhance motoneuron responses to modulations of synaptic drive over a physiologically significant range of frequencies.},

abstract = {1. The aim of this study was to examine the nature of motoneuron firing-rate modulation in type-identified motor units during smoothly graded contractions of the cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle evoked by stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Motoneuron discharge patterns, firing rates, and the extent of firing-rate modulation in individual units were studied, as was the extent of concomitant changes in firing rates within pairs of simultaneously active units. 2. In 71 pairs of simultaneously active motor units, studied during 41 evoked contractions, the motoneurons' discharge rates and patterns were measured by processing the cells' recorded action potentials through windowing devices and storing their timing in computer memory. Once recruited, most motoneurons increased their firing rates over a limited range of increasing muscle tension and then maintained a fairly constant firing rate as muscle force continued to rise. Most motoneurons also decreased their firing rates over a slightly larger, but still limited, range of declining muscle force before they were derecruited. Although this was the most common discharge pattern recorded, several other interesting patterns were also seen. 3. The mean firing rate for slow twitch (type S) motor units (27.8 imp/s, 5,092 activations) was found to be significantly different from the mean firing rate for fast twitch (type FI motor units (48.4 imp/s, 11,272 activations; Student's t-test, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the mean firing rates of fast twitch, fatigue-resistant (type FR) and fast twitch, fatigable (type FF) motor units. When the relationship between motoneuron firing rate and whole-muscle force was analyzed, it was noted that, in general, smaller, lower threshold motor units began firing at lower rates and reached lower peak firing rates than did larger, higher threshold motor units. These results confirm both earlier experimental observations and predictions made by other investigators on the basis of computer simulations of the cat MG motor pool, but are in contrast to motor-unit discharge behavior recorded in sor-ne human motor-unit studies. 4. The extent of concomitant changes in firing rate within pairs of simultaneously active motor units was examined to estimate the extent of simultaneous motoneuron firing-rate modulation across the motoneuron pool. A smoothed (5 point sliding of the two motoneurons' instantaneous firing rates was plotted against each other, and the slope and statistical significance of the relationship was determined. In 16 motor-unit pairs, the slope of the motoneurons' firing-rate relationship was significantly distinct from 0. Parallel firing-rate modulation (<10-fold difference in firing rate change reflected by a slope of >0.1) was noted only in pairs containing motor units of like physiological type and then only if they were of similar recruitment threshold. 5. Other investigators have demonstrated that changes in a motoneuron's ''steady-state'' firing rate predictably reflect changes in the amount of effective synaptic current that cell is receiving. The finding in the present study of limited parallel firing-rate modulation between simultaneously active motoneurons would suggest that changes in the synaptic drive to the various motoneurons of the pool is unevenly distributed. This finding, in addition to the findings of orderly motor-unit recruitment and the relationship between motor-unit recruitment threshold and motoneuron firing cannot be adequately accommodated for by the existing models of the synaptic organization in motoneuron pools. Therefore a new model of the synaptic organization within the motoneuron pool has been proposed.},

abstract = {In standing subjects, ankle dorsiflexion evoked short-latency responses (SLRs) at 41 and 57 ms, on the average, in soleus (Sol) and flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), respectively. Medium-latency responses (MLRs) occurred at 70 and 95 ms. The time between the MLRs was 25 ms and between the SLRs was 16 ms. The difference between these two values represents the extra-time to conduct the FDB volley for MLR from distal to proximal muscle, in excess to that for SLR. The velocity of the afferents mediating the FDB MLR (21.4 m/s on average) was estimated by dividing the distance between the two muscles by the sum of the above extra-time and the conduction time of Ia fibres along the same distance. The central delay of FDB MLR (6.7 ms on average) was obtained by dividing the distance between FDB and spinal cord by the sum of afferent and efferent MLR conduction times. The central delay of FDB SLR (1.4 ms) was analogously obtained. These findings give an estimation of the conduction velocity of the group II afferent fibres in humans and support the hypothesis that the FDB MLR is relayed through a spinal oligosynaptic pathway.},

abstract = {Stimulation of motor units (MUs) with repeated pulses evokes tetanic contractions, which consist of overlapping mechanical responses. The summation of these responses into tetanus is a nonlinear process due to the dynamic changes in the amplitudes and time parameters of the successive components. In order to study these changes, two MUs (one fast and one slow) of rat medial gastrocnemius muscle were stimulated with a progressively increasing number of pulses, from one (i = 1) to sixteen (i = 16) at a frequency of 15 Hz for the slow MU and 60 Hz for the fast MU. The individual responses were calculated by subtracting the (i)th from the (i + 1)th tetanus recording. The contractions obtained following subtraction were modeled using a novel 6-parameter analytical function. The main conclusions of this study are (1) the newly presented analytical function is able to precisely describe the variable shape of all subtracted experimental contractions; (2) the shapes of successive contractions are variable and the subtracted contractions differ from the individual twitches; (3) as the pulse number increases, the parameters of the subtracted contractions change in a different manner for the slow and fast MUs: for the slow MU, the maximal forces and the time parameters increase considerably up to the 4th response, after which they remain nearly constant or show only a slight increase; for the fast MU, the maximal forces and durations also increase, whereas the remaining time parameters initially increase and then maintain a constant level or decrease, which explains the sag phenomenon visible in the unfused tetanus of fast MUs.

Simultaneous activation of four to five additional units, using muscle nerve stimulation, allowed an examination of unit force summation. Linear force addition was found in 73{\%} of the units, while 25{\%} added only about half of their twitch force to the twitch force of the nerve-activated units. ''Nonadditive'' units had significantly weaker twitch tensions than the units which added linearly. Lengthening or shortening the whole muscle, from maximal isometric settings, reduced whole muscle twitch tension as well as muscle unit tension. Injury to the lateral rectus muscle did not significantly alter whole muscle tension. These findings suggest that the known strial and branching arrangement of these muscle fibers, as well as the complex interfiber matrix, may help explain the force reduction in some muscle units and the whole muscle's resistance to insult.

abstract = {Paradoxical effect of QX-314 on persistent inward currents and bistable behavior in spinal motoneurons in vivo. J. Neurophysiol. 82: 2518-2527, 1999. Spinal motoneurons can exhibit bistable behavior, which consists of stable self-sustained firing that is initiated by a brief excitatory input and terminated by brief inhibitory input. This bistable behavior is generated by a persistent inward current (I-PIC). In cat motoneurons with low input conductances and slow axonal conduction velocities, I-PIC exhibits little decay with time and thus self-sustained firing is longlasting. In contrast, in cells that have high input conductances and fast conduction velocities, I-PIC decays with time, and these cells cannot maintain long duration self-sustained firing. An alternative way to measure bistable behavior is to assess plateau potentials after the action potential has been blocked by intracellular injection of QX-314 to block sodium (Na+) currents. However, QX-314 also blocks calcium (Ca2+) currents and, because I-PIC may be generated by a mixture of Ca2+ and Na+ currents, a reduction in amplitude of I-PIC was expected. We therefore systematically compared the properties of I-PIC in a sample of cells recorded with QX-314 to a control sample of cells without QX-314, which was obtained in a previous study. Single-electrode voltage-clamp techniques were applied in spinal motoneurons in the decerebrate cat preparation following administration of a standardized dose of the noradrenergic alpha 1 agonist methoxamine. in the sample with QX-314, the average value of I-PIC was only about half that in the control sample. However, the reduction of I-PIC was much greater in cells with slow as compared with fast conduction velocities. Because a substantial portion of I-PIC originates in dendritic regions and because conduction velocity covaries with the extent of the dendritic tree, this result suggests that QX-314 may fail to diffuse very far into the dendrites of the largest motoneurons. The analysis of the decay of I-PIC and plateau potentials in cells with QX-314 also produced an unexpected result: QX-314 virtually eliminated time-dependent decay in both I-PIC and plateau potentials. Consequently, I-PIC became equally persistent in high and low input conductance cells. Therefore the decay in I-PIC in high input conductance cells in the absence of QX-314 is not due to an intrinsic tendency of the underlying inward current to decay. Instead it is possible that the decay may result from activation of a slow outward current. Overall, these results show that QX-314 has a profound effect on I-PIC and thus plateau potentials obtained using QX-314 do not accurately reflect the properties of I-PIC in normal cells without QX-314.},

The dramatic increase in data bandwidth and volume associated with multichannel recording requires a significant computational effort which presents major design challenges for brain-machine interface (BMI) system in terms of power dissipation and hardware area. In this paper, we present a streaming method for implementing real-time memory efficient neural signal processing hardware. This method exploits the pseudo-stationary property of neural signals and, thus, eliminates the need of temporal storage in batch-based processing. The proposed technique can significantly reduce memory size and dynamic power while effectively maintaining the accuracy of algorithms. The streaming kernel is robust when compared to the batch processing over a range of BMI benchmark algorithms. The advantages of the streaming kernel when implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices are also demonstrated.},

abstract = {The present work describes the biomechanical modeling of human postural mechanics in the saggital plane and the use of optimal control to generate open-loop raising-up movements from a squatting position. The biomechanical model comprises 10 equivalent musculotendon actuators, based on a 40 muscles model, and three links (shank, thigh and HAT-Head, Arms and Trunk). Optimal control solutions are achieved through algorithms based on the Consistent Approximations Theory (Schwartz and Polak, 1996), where the continuous non-linear dynamics is represented in a discrete space by means of a Runge-Kutta integration and the control signals in a spline-coefficient functional space. This leads to non-linear programming problems solved by a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. Due to the highly non-linear and unstable nature of the posture dynamics, numerical convergence is difficult, and specific strategies must be implemented in order to allow convergence. Results for control (muscular excitations) and angular trajectories are shown using two final simulation times, as well as specific control strategies are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Vision (V) and touch (T) help stabilize our standing body, but little is known on the time-interval necessary for the brain to process the sensory inflow (or its removal) and exploit the new information (or counteract its removal). We have estimated the latency of onset and the time-course of the changes in postural control mode following addition or withdrawal of sensory information and the effect of anticipation thereof. Ten subjects stood in tandem position. They wore LCD goggles that allowed or removed vision, or lightly touched (eyes-closed) with the index finger (haptic stimulation) a pad that could be suddenly lowered (passive task). In different sessions, sensory shifts were deliberately produced by opening (or closing) the eyes or touching the pad (or lifting the finger) (active task). We recorded eyelid movement and finger force (<1N), sway of center of foot pressure (CoP), electromyogram (EMG) of soleus, tibialis and peroneus muscle, bilaterally, and of extensor indicis. The latency of the CoP and EMG changes following the shifts were statistically estimated on the averaged traces of 50 repetitions per condition. Muscle activity and sway adaptively decreased in amplitude on adding stabilizing visual or haptic information. The time-interval from the sensory shift to decrease in EMG and sway was ∼0.5-2 s under both conditions. It was shorter for tibialis than peroneus or soleus and shorter for visual than haptic shift. CoP followed the tibialis by ∼0.2 s. Slightly shorter intervals were observed following active sensory shifts. Latencies of EMG and postural changes were the shortest on removal of both haptic and visual information. Subsequently, the time taken to reach the steady-state was ∼1-3 s under both active and passive tasks. A startle response at ∼100 ms could precede EMG changes. Reaction-time contractions in response to sensory shifts appeared at ∼200 ms, earlier than the adaptive changes. Changes in postural behavior require a finite amount of time from visual or haptic shift, much longer than reflexes or rapid voluntary responses, suggesting a time-consuming central integration process. This process is longer on addition than removal of haptic information, indicating a heavier computational load. These findings should be taken into account when considering problems of sensorimotor integration in elderly subjects or patients and when designing simulation models of human balance.},

abstract = {This study shows that center-of-pressure (COP) traces that closely resemble physiologically measured COP functions can be produced by an appropriate selection of model parameters in a simple feedback model of the human postural control system. Variations in the values of stiffness, damping, time delay, and noise level determine the values of 15 sway measures commonly used to characterize spontaneous sway. Results from model simulations indicate that there is a high degree of correlation among these sway measures, and the measures cluster into three different groups. Only two principal components accounted for about 92{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variation among the different sway measures analyzed. This model can be used to formulate hypotheses regarding the cause of postural control deficits reported in the literature. This is accomplished using a multidimensional optimization procedure to estimate model parameters from a diverse set of spontaneous sway measures. These model parameters describe physiologically meaningful features of the postural control system as opposed to conventional sway measures that provide only a parametric description of sway. To show the application of this method, we applied it to published data of spontaneous sway from elderly subjects and contrasted it to the data of young healthy subjects. We found that modest increases in stiffness and damping and a fairly large increase in noise level with aging could account for the variety of sway measures reported in the literature for elderly subjects.},

abstract = {A computer model of the motor unit number estimation procedure was developed to evaluate the sampling error associated with estimates of the number of motor units in muscles. Two different distributions were used to model the motor unit amplitude distribution and were chosen in such a manner that they qualitatively matched the distributions observed under both normal and neurogenic conditions. As expected, the results indicated that estimation error decreases as a function of sample size. However, the relationship between these two variables was nonlinear in the sense that successive increases in sample size lead to progressively smaller decreases in estimation error. The results also indicated that the shape of the motor unit amplitude distribution plays an important role. Specifically, estimates obtained using the distribution modeling normal muscle were generally higher than the actual number of motor units in the muscle, which was not the case for the distribution modeling neurogenic muscle. In addition, the neurogenic distribution was associated with much smaller estimation error, suggesting that motor unit number estimation is well suited to the analysis of neurogenic disease processes.

abstract = {This work examined if currently available electromyography (EMG) driven models, that are calibrated to satisfy joint moments about one single degree of freedom (DOF), could provide the same musculotendon unit (MTU) force solution, when driven by the same input data, but calibrated about a different DOF. We then developed a novel and comprehensive EMG-driven model of the human lower extremity that used EMG signals from 16 muscle groups to drive 34 MTUs and satisfy the resulting joint moments simultaneously produced about four DOFs during different motor tasks. This also led to the development of a calibration procedure that allowed identifying a set of subject-specific parameters that ensured physiological behavior for the 34 MTUs. Results showed that currently available single-DOF models did not provide the same unique MTU force solution for the same input data. On the other hand, the MTU force solution predicted by our proposed multi-DOF model satisfied joint moments about multiple DOFs without loss of accuracy compared to single-DOF models corresponding to each of the four DOFs. The predicted MTU force solution was (1) a function of experimentally measured EMGs, (2) the result of physiological MTU excitation, (3) reflected different MTU contraction strategies associated to different motor tasks, (4) coordinated a greater number of MTUs with respect to currently available single-DOF models, and (5) was not specific to an individual DOF dynamics. Therefore, our proposed methodology has the potential of producing a more dynamically consistent and generalizable MTU force solution than was possible using single-DOF EMG-driven models. This will help better address the important scientific questions previously approached using single-DOF EMG-driven modeling. Furthermore, it might have applications in the development of human-machine interfaces for assistive devices.},

@article{Cnyrim2009,
abstract = {Human stance is inherently unstable. A small deviation from upright body orientation is enough to yield a gravitational component in the ankle joint torque, which tends to accelerate the body further away from upright ('gravitational torque'; magnitude is related to body-space lean angle). Therefore, to maintain a given body lean position, a corresponding compensatory torque must be generated. It is well known that subjects use kinematic sensory information on body-space lean from the vestibular system for this purpose. Less is known about kinetic cues from force/torque receptors. Previous work indicated that they are involved in compensating external contact forces such as a pull or push having impact on the body. In this study, we hypothesized that they play, in addition, a role when the vestibular estimate of the gravitational torque becomes erroneous. Reasons may be sudden changes in body mass, for instance by a load, or an impairment of the vestibular system. To test this hypothesis, we mimicked load effects on the gravitational torque in normal subjects and in patients with chronic bilateral vestibular loss (VL) with eyes closed. We added/subtracted extra torque to the gravitational torque by applying an external contact force (via cable winches and a body harness). The extra torque was referenced to body-space lean, using different proportionality factors. We investigated how it affected body-space lean responses that we evoked using sinusoidal tilts of the support surface (motion platform) with different amplitudes and frequencies (normals +/-1 degrees, +/-2 degrees, and +/-4 degrees at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 Hz; patients +/-1 degrees and +/-2 degrees at 0.05 and 0.1 Hz). We found that added/subtracted extra torque scales the lean response in a systematic way, leading to increase/decrease in lean excursion. Expressing the responses in terms of gain and phase curves, we compared the experimental findings to predictions obtained from a recently published sensory feedback model. For the trials in which the extra torque tended to endanger stance control, predictions in normals were better when the model included force cues than without these cues. This supports our notion that force cues provide an automatic 'gravitational load compensation' upon changes in body mass in normals. The findings in the patients support our notion that the presumed force cue mechanism provides furthermore vestibular loss compensation. Patients showed a body-space stabilization that cannot be explained by ankle angle proprioception, but must involve graviception, most likely by force cues. Our findings suggest that force cues contribute considerably to the redundancy and robustness of the human stance control system.},

abstract = {Human grasping relies on feedforward control that is monitored and corrected on-line by means of sensory feedback. While much of the sensory mechanisms underpinning hand-object interaction are known, information has been lacking about muscle receptor responses during the phases before and after actual object contact. We therefore let subjects use their thumb and fingers to grasp blocks presented to them while we recorded muscle afferents from the thumb and finger extensor muscles along with wrist and digit kinematics, and electromyographic activity. The kinematics of the task was indistinguishable from "normal" grasping. None of the afferents encoded either object contact or finger apposition. Both primary and secondary afferents were more phase advanced on the parent muscle lengths than expected from previous studies as well as from their responses to imposed length changes of their parent muscles. Thus, the discharges of both primary and secondary afferents were well correlated to the tendon velocity of their parent muscles and that of primary afferents also to acceleration whereas neither appeared to encode muscle length as such. Decoding the velocity of muscle length changes were significantly improved if the discharge of Golgi tendon organ afferents were taken into account along with that of the muscle spindle afferents. We propose that these findings may be explained by the biomechanical properties of contracting muscles. Moreover, we conclude that it seems unlikely that the muscle spindle afferents recorded in this task have any role in providing "proprioceptive" information pertaining to the size of an object grasped.},

abstract = {It has been considered that the brain stabilizes unstable body dynamics by regulating co-activation levels of antagonist muscles. Here we critically reexamined this established theory of impedance control in a postural balancing task using a novel EMG-based human-computer interface, in which subjects were asked to balance a virtual inverted pendulum using visual feedback information on the pendulum's position. The pendulum was actuated by a pair of antagonist joint torques determined in real-time by activations of the corresponding pair of antagonist ankle muscles of subjects standing upright. This motor-task raises a frustrated environment; a large feedback time delay in the sensorimotor loop, as a source of instability, might favor adopting the non-reactive, preprogrammed impedance control, but the ankle muscles are relatively hard to co-activate, which hinders subjects from adopting the impedance control. This study aimed at discovering how experimental subjects resolved this frustrated environment through motor learning. One third of subjects adapted to the balancing task in a way of the impedance-like control. It was remarkable, however, that the majority of subjects did not adopt the impedance control. Instead, they acquired a smart and energetically efficient strategy, in which two muscles were inactivated simultaneously at a sequence of optimal timings, leading to intermittent appearance of periods of time during which the pendulum was not actively actuated. Characterizations of muscle inactivations and the pendulum¡{\{}{\c{C}}{\}}s sway showed that the strategy adopted by those subjects was a type of intermittent control that utilizes a stable manifold of saddle-type unstable upright equilibrium that appeared in the state space of the pendulum when the active actuation was turned off.},

abstract = {Fibers from the tibial nerve of rat were isolated and spike activity recorded using monopolar hook electrodes. The receptive field (RF) of each recorded unit on the glabrous skin of the foot was mechanically stimulated with waveforms comprised of various frequency sine waves in addition to increasing levels of white noise. Single-unit responses were recorded for both rapidly adapting (RA) and slowly adapting (SA) units. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output was quantified by the correlation coefficient (C1) between the input sine wave and the nerve responses. The addition of noise enhanced signal transmission in both RA and SA fibers. With increasing noise, the initially inverted "V"-shaped, zero-noise tuning curves for RA fibers broadened and eventually inverted. There was a large expansion of the frequencies that the RA receptor responded to with increasing noise input. On the other hand, the typical shape of the SA fiber tuning curves remained invariant, at all noise levels tested. C1 values continued to increase with larger noise input for higher frequencies, but did not do so at the lowest frequencies. For both RA and SA fibers the responses with added noise tended to be rate modulated at the low-frequency end, and followed nonlinear stochastic resonance (SR) properties at the higher frequencies. The changes in the tuning properties due to noise found here, as well as preliminary psychophysics data, imply that external noise is relevant for sensing small periodic signals in the environment. All current models of sensory perception assume that the tuning properties of receptors determined in the absence of noise are preserved during everyday tasks. Our results indicate that this is not true in a noisy environment.},

abstract = {Successful performance of a sensorimotor task arises from the interaction of descending commands from the brain with the intrinsic properties of the lower levels of the sensorimotor system, including the dynamic mechanical properties of muscle, the natural coordinates of somatosensory receptors, the interneuronal circuitry of the spinal cord, and computational noise in these elements. Engineering models of biological motor control often oversimplify or even ignore these lower levels because they appear to complicate an already difficult problem. We modeled three highly simplified control systems that reflect the essential attributes of the lower levels in three tasks: acquiring a target in the face of random torque-pulse perturbations, optimizing fusimotor gain for the same perturbations, and minimizing postural error versus energy consumption during low- versus high-frequency perturbations. The emergent properties of the lower levels maintained stability in the face of feedback delays, resolved redundancy in over-complete systems, and helped to estimate loads and respond to perturbations. We suggest a general hierarchical approach to modeling sensorimotor systems, which better reflects the real control problem faced by the brain, as a first step toward identifying the actual neurocomputational steps and their anatomical partitioning in the brain.},

abstract = {The reaction to an unexpected balance disturbance is unpracticed, often startling and frequently associated with falls. This everyday situation can be reproduced in an experimental setting by exposing standing humans to sudden, unexpected and controlled movements of a support surface. In this review, we focus on the responses to the very first balance perturbation, the so-called first trial reactions (FTRs). Detailed analysis of FTRs may have important implications, both for clinical practice (providing new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying accidental falls in real life) and for understanding human physiology (what triggers and mediates these FTRs, and what is the relation to startle responses?). Several aspects of the FTRs have become clear. FTRs are characterized by an exaggerated postural reaction, with large EMG responses and co-contracting muscles in multiple body segments. This balance reaction is associated with marked postural instability (greater body sway to the perturbation). When the same perturbation is repeated, the size of the postural response habituates and the instability disappears. Other issues about FTRs remain largely unresolved, and these are addressed here. First, the functional role of FTRs is discussed. It appears that FTRs produce primarily increased trunk flexion during the multi-segmental response to postural perturbations, thus producing instability. Second, we consider which sensory signals trigger and modulate FTRs, placing specific emphasis on the role of vestibular signals. Surprisingly, vestibular signals appear to have no triggering role, but vestibular loss leads to excessive upper body FTRs due to loss of the normal modulatory influence. Third, we address the question whether startle-like responses are contributing to FTRs triggered by proprioceptive signals. We explain why this issue is still unresolved, mainly because of methodological difficulties involved in separating FTRs from 'pure' startle responses. Fourth, we review new work about the influence of perturbation direction on FTRs. Recent work from our group shows that the largest FTRs are obtained for toe-up support surface rotations which perturb the COM in the posterior direction. This direction corresponds to the directional preponderance for falls seen both in the balance laboratory and in daily life. Finally, we briefly touch upon clinical diagnostic issues, addressing whether FTRs (as opposed to habituated responses) could provide a more ecologically valid perspective of postural instability in patients compared to healthy subjects. We conclude that FTRs are an important source of information about human balance performance, both in health and disease. Future studies should no longer discard FTRs, but routinely include these in their analyses. Particular emphasis should be placed on the link between FTRs and everyday balance performance (including falls), and on the possible role played by startle reactions in triggering or modulating FTRs.},

abstract = {Motor units within human muscles usually exhibit a significant degree of short-term synchronization. Such coincident spiking typically has been attributed to last-order projections that provide common synaptic input across motor neurons. The extent of branched input arising directly from cortical neurons has often been suggested as a critical factor determining the magnitude of short-term synchrony. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to quantify motor unit synchrony in a variety of human muscles differing in the presumed extent of cortical input to their respective motor nuclei. Cross-correlation histograms were generated from the firing times of 551 pairs of motor units in 16 human muscles. Motor unit synchrony tended to be weakest for proximal muscles and strongest for more distal muscles. Previous work in monkeys and humans has shown that the strength of cortical inputs to motor neurons to also exhibit a similar proximal-to-distal gradient. However, in the present study, proximal-distal location was not an exclusive predictor of synchrony magnitude. The muscle that exhibited the least synchrony was an elbow flexor, whereas the greatest synchrony was most often found in intrinsic foot muscles. Furthermore, the strength of corticospinal inputs to abductor hallucis (AH) an intrinsic foot muscle, as assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation, was weaker than that projecting to tibialis anterior (TA), even though AH had higher synchrony values compared to TA. We argue, therefore, that factors other than the potency of cortical inputs to motor neurons, such as the number of motor neurons innervating a muscle, significantly affects motor unit synchrony.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of peripheral afferent stimuli on the synchrony between brain and muscle activity as estimated by corticomuscular coherence (CMC). Electroencephalogram (EEG) from sensorimotor cortex and electromyogram (EMG) from two intrinsic hand muscles were recorded during a key grip motor task, and the modulation of CMC caused by afferent electrical and mechanical stimulation was measured. The particular stimuli used were graded single-pulse electrical stimuli, above threshold for perception and activating cutaneous afferents, applied to the dominant or non-dominant index finger, and a pulsed mechanical displacement of the gripped object causing the subject to feel as if the object may be dropped. Following electrical stimulation of the dominant index finger, the level of $\beta$-range (14-36 Hz) CMC was reduced in a stimulus intensity-dependent fashion for up to 400 ms post-stimulus, then returned with greater magnitude before falling to baseline levels over 2.5 s, outlasting the reflex and evoked changes in EMG and EEG. Subjects showing no baseline $\beta$-range CMC nevertheless showed post-stimulus increases in $\beta$-range CMC with the same time course as those with baseline $\beta$-range CMC. The mechanical stimuli produced similar modulation of $\beta$-range CMC. Electrical stimuli to the non-dominant index finger produced no significant increase in $\beta$-range CMC. The results suggest that both cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents have access to circuits generating CMC, but that only a functionally relevant stimulus produces significant modulation of the background $\beta$-range CMC, providing further evidence that $\beta$-range CMC has an important role in sensorimotor integration.},

abstract = {This study focuses on neuromuscular mechanisms behind ankle torque and EMG variability during a maintained isometric plantarflexion contraction. Experimentally obtained torque standard deviation (SD) and soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) EMG envelope mean and SD increased with mean torque for a wide range of torque levels. Computer simulations were performed on a biophysically-based neuromuscular model of the triceps surae consisting of premotoneuronal spike trains (the global input, GI) driving the motoneuron pools of the SOL, MG and LG muscles, which activate their respective muscle units. Two types of point processes were adopted to represent the statistics of the GI, Poisson and Gamma. Simulations showed a better agreement with experimental results when the GI was modeled by Gamma point processes having lower orders (higher variability) for higher target torques. At the same time, the simulations reproduced well the experimental data of EMG envelope mean and SD as a function of mean plantarflexion torque, for the three muscles. These results suggest that the experimentally found relations between torque-EMG variability as a function of mean plantarflexion torque level depend not only on the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron pools and the muscle units innervated, but also on the increasing variability of the premotoneuronal GI spike trains when their mean rates increase to command a higher plantarflexion torque level. The simulations also provided information on spike train statistics of several hundred motoneurons that compose the triceps surae, providing a wide picture of the associated mechanisms behind torque and EMG variability.},

abstract = {Transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) is a new promising technique for modulating spinal cord function in humans. However, its effects on corticospinal pathways and lower motorneuron excitability are poorly understood. We studied the effects of tsDCS on motor unit recruitment by evaluating changes in motor unit number (MUNE) and peripheral silent period (PSP) after sham (s-tsDCS), anodal (a-tsDCS) and cathodal (c-tsDCS) tsDCS applied either over the cervical or the lower thoracic spinal cord in healthy subjects. For the calculation of MUNE we used the multipoint incremental technique recording from either the ulnar nerve innervated abductor digiti minimi (ADM) or the median nerve innervated abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. c-tsDCS dramatically increases MUNE values following cervical polarization, while sham and anodal polarization have no significant effect (APB: F(4,99)=26.4, p<0.001, two-way repeated measures ANOVA with "time" and "stimulation" as factors; ADM: F(4,99)=22.1, p<0.0001). At the same time, c-tsDCS dampened PSP respect to sham and anodal conditions (p<0.0001). Interestingly, also thoracic c-tsDCS significantly improved motor unit recruitment compared with both s-tsDCS and a-tsDCS (APB: F(4,99)=20.1, p<0.0001; ADM: F(4,99)=16.6, p<0.0001). Our data in healthy subjects suggest that tsDCS, possibly also through supraspinal effects, could provide a novel therapeutic tool in managing several pathological conditions characterized by reduced motor unit recruitment, such as stroke and spinal cord injuries. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {A Web-based simulation system of the spinal cord circuitry responsible for muscle control is described. The simulator employs two-compartment motoneuron models for S, FR and FF types, with synaptic inputs acting through conductance variations. Four motoneuron pools with their associated interneurons are represented in the simulator, with the possibility of inclusion of more than 2,000 neurons and 2,000,000 synapses. Each motoneuron action potential is followed, after a conduction delay, by a motor unit potential and a motor unit twitch. The sums of all motor unit potentials and twitches result in the electromyogram (EMG), and the muscle force, respectively. Inputs to the motoneuron pool come from populations of interneurons (Ia reciprocal inhibitory interneurons, Ib interneurons, and Renshaw cells) and from stochastic point processes associated with descending tracts. To simulate human electrophysiological experiments, the simulator incorporates external nerve stimulation with orthodromic and antidromic propagation. This provides the mechanisms for reflex generation and activation of spinal neuronal circuits that modulate the activity of another motoneuron pool (e.g., by reciprocal inhibition). The generation of the H-reflex by the Ia-motoneuron pool system and its modulation by spinal cord interneurons is included in the simulation system. Studies with the simulator may include the statistics of individual motoneuron or interneuron spike trains or the collective effect of a motor nucleus on the dynamics of muscle force control. Properties associated with motor-unit recruitment, motor-unit synchronization, recurrent inhibition and reciprocal inhibition may be investigated.},

abstract = {Tactile performance of human fingertips is associated with activity of the nerve endings and sensitivity of the soft tissue within the fingertip to the static and dynamic skin indentation. The nerve endings in the fingertips sense the stress/strain states developed within the soft tissue, which are affected by the material properties of the tissues. The vibrotactile sensation and tactile performance are thus believed to be strongly influenced by the nonlinear and time-dependent properties of the soft tissues. The purpose of the present research is to simulate the biomechanics of tactile sensation. A two-dimensional model, which incorporates the essential anatomical structures of a finger (i.e. skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and nail), has been used for the analysis. The skin tissue is assumed to be hyperelastic and viscoelastic. The subcutaneous tissue is considered to be a nonlinear, biphasic material composed of a hyperelastic solid and an inviscid fluid phase. The nail and bone are considered to be linearly elastic. The advantages of the proposed fingertip model over the previous "waterbed" and "continuum" fingertip models include its ability to predict the deflection profile of the fingertip surface, the stress and strain distributions within the soft tissue, and most importantly, the dynamic response of the fingertip to mechanical stimuli. The proposed model is applied to simulate the mechanical responses of a fingertip under a line load, and in one-point (1PT) and two-point (2PT) tactile discrimination tests. The model's predictions of the deflection profiles of a fingertip surface under a line load agree well with the reported experimental data. Assuming that the mechanoreceptors in the dermis sense the stimuli associated with normal strains (the vertical and horizontal strains) and strain energy density, our numerical results suggest that the threshold of 2PT discrimination may lie between 2.0 and 3.0 mm, which is consistent with the published experimental data. The present study represents an effort to develop a structural model of the fingertip that incorporates its anatomical structure, and the nonlinear and time-dependent properties of the soft tissues.},

abstract = {During low-frequency (<1.5 Hz) voluntary oscillations of the foot, placed on a rotating platform, onset of the Tibialis Anterior (TA) EMG paradoxically phase-lags the onset of dorsiflexion, suggesting that initial dorsiflexion is sustained by recoil of elastic structures that were stretched during plantarflexion. It is argued that the lag would disappear if the EMG onset were referred to the foot passive equilibrium position rather than to the movement onset. This hypothesis was tested in ten subjects who, after assessment of foot equilibrium position, voluntarily oscillated their foot at various frequencies (0.2-3 Hz) over three angular ranges: a mid range (foot crossing the equilibrium symmetrically), a high range (whole excursion above equilibrium) and a low range (whole excursion below equilibrium). In the mid range, phase relations were measured between the crossing of equilibrium position and the onset of the TA EMG during dorsiflexion or the onset of Soleus EMG during plantarflexion. In both cases, the paradoxical lag of EMG on movement was absent, phase curves started around zero and could be well fitted by a second order model. Phase curves with similar features were also obtained in the high and low ranges (no crossing of equilibrium) but correlating the onset of the EMG burst to the onset of the related movement. Altogether, these findings show that in all ranges of the joint excursion, the homology is between the EMG onset and the moment when the foot draws away from equilibrium. Based on the observed pattern of muscular activation, we suggest that voluntary foot oscillation in any movement range is sustained by one sinusoidal central command that, when equilibrium is crossed, is clipped in two half-waves reciprocally distributed to the couple of antagonist muscles. A simple neural circuit for this operation is proposed.},

abstract = {We propose a computationally coherent model of cerebellar motor learning based on the feedback-error-learning scheme. We assume that climbing fiber responses represent motor-command errors generated by some of the premotor networks such as the feedback controllers at the spinal-, brain stem- and cerebral levels. Thus, in our model, climbing fiber responses are considered to convey motor errors in the motor-command coordinates rather than in the sensory coordinates. Based on the long-term depression in Purkinje cells each corticonuclear microcomplex in different regions of the cerebellum learns to execute predictive and coordinative control of different types of movements. Ultimately, it acquires an inverse model of a specific controlled object and complements crude control by the premotor networks. This general model is developed in detail as a specific neural circuit model for the lateral hemisphere. A new experiment is suggested to elucidate the coordinate frame in which climbing fiber responses are represented.},

abstract = {This article presents a biologically-inspired framework for humanoid postural control. It complies with the main features of human postural control that are extracted from recent studies. In this article, the human body is abstracted as a single-inverted pendulum jointed with a foot that rests freely on a supporting surface. In particular, disturbances affecting posture are addressed and accommodated within the proposed framework. Among these are external forces and motion of support surface on which the body stands. The main components of this framework are: 1. A state-feedback mechanism for stabilizing the unstable dynamics of the body. 2. A tracking loop for robustly achieving desired voluntary orientations. 3. A feed-forward control primarily for improving the response to voluntary motions. 4. A stand-alone vestibular sensory fusion algorithm for estimating body orientation. 5. An external-disturbance estimator and a corresponding compensation for minimizing the effect of external disturbances. These components are interconnected in a way that qualifies this framework to modularly address the multi-segment body postural control problem. Although no postural stability measure is explicitly incorporated, experiments run on a special-purpose humanoid demonstrate the stability and the performance merits of the presented framework.},

abstract = {Patients with diabetes occasionally develop clinical and electrodiagnostic features suggestive of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). To clarify the role of diabetes in patients with a CIDP-like syndrome, we compared the clinical, pathological, and electrodiagnostic features of 14 patients (10 men, 4 women) with diabetes and CIDP (DM-CIDP) to 60 patients with idiopathic CIDP (I-CIDP). The average duration of diabetes was 9 years. The patients with DM-CIDP were older and more often complained of imbalance compared to the idiopathic group, but the frequency of other symptoms and neurologic findings were similar. The mean amplitude of the ulnar compound muscle action potential in the DM-CIDP group was comparatively reduced, the sural sensory nerve action potential was more often absent, and axonal loss was more commonly observed on nerve biopsy. The response rate to treatment was similar, but the magnitude of functional recovery was greater in patients with I-CIDP. Thus, our patients with diabetes and CIDP had clinical features similar to those with idiopathic CIDP, but their nerve conduction studies and nerve biopsies showed more severe axonal loss and the degree of improvement following treatment was less favorable. These differences most likely reflect the additive effects of superimposed diabetic axonal polyneuropathy in patients who develop CIDP.},

abstract = {In primates, the sense of touch has traditionally been considered to be a spatial modality, drawing an analogy to the visual system. In this view, stimuli are encoded in spatial patterns of activity over the sheet of receptors embedded in the skin. We propose that the spatial processing mode is complemented by a temporal one. Indeed, the transduction and processing of complex, high-frequency skin vibrations have been shown to play an important role in tactile texture perception, and the frequency composition of vibrations shapes the evoked percept. Mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the glabrous skin exhibit temporal patterning in their responses, but the importance and behavioral relevance of spike timing, particularly for naturalistic stimuli, remains to be elucidated. Based on neurophysiological recordings from Rhesus macaques, we show that spike timing conveys information about the frequency composition of skin vibrations, both for individual afferents and for afferent populations, and that the temporal fidelity varies across afferent class. Furthermore, the perception of skin vibrations, measured in human subjects, is better predicted when spike timing is taken into account, and the resolution that predicts perception best matches the optimal resolution of the respective afferent classes. In light of these results, the peripheral representation of complex skin vibrations draws a powerful analogy with the auditory and vibrissal systems.},

abstract = {Microneurography is a method using metal microelectrodes to investigate directly identified neural traffic in myelinated as well as unmyelinated efferent and afferent nerves leading to and coming from muscle and skin in human peripheral nerves in situ. The present paper reviews how this technique has been used in clinical neurophysiology to elucidate the neural mechanisms of autonomic regulation, motor control and sensory functions in humans under physiological and pathological conditions. Microneurography is particularly important to investigate efferent and afferent neural traffic in unmyelinated C fibers. The recording of efferent discharges in postganglionic sympathetic C efferent fibers innervating muscle and skin (muscle sympathetic nerve activity; MSNA and skin sympathetic nerve activity; SSNA) provides direct information about neural control of autonomic effector organs including blood vessels and sweat glands. Sympathetic microneurography has become a potent tool to reveal neural functions and dysfunctions concerning blood pressure control and thermoregulation. This recording has been used not only in wake conditions but also in sleep to investigate changes in sympathetic neural traffic during sleep and sleep-related events such as sleep apnea. The same recording was also successfully carried out by astronauts during spaceflight. Recordings of afferent discharges from muscle mechanoreceptors have been used to understand the mechanisms of motor control. Muscle spindle afferent information is particularly important for the control of fine precise movements. It may also play important roles to predict behavior outcomes during learning of a motor task. Recordings of discharges in myelinated afferent fibers from skin mechanoreceptors have provided not only objective information about mechanoreceptive cutaneous sensation but also the roles of these signals in fine motor control. Unmyelinated mechanoreceptive afferent discharges from hairy skin seem to be important to convey cutaneous sensation to the central structures related to emotion. Recordings of afferent discharges in thin myelinated and unmyelinated fibers from nociceptors in muscle and skin have been used to provide information concerning pain. Recordings of afferent discharges of different types of cutaneous C-nociceptors identified by marking method have become an important tool to reveal the neural mechanisms of cutaneous sensations such as an itch. No direct microneurographic evidence has been so far proved regarding the effects of sympathoexcitation on sensitization of muscle and skin sensory receptors at least in healthy humans.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects of the study were 24 patients with gonarthrosis (mean age 58.4 +/- 2.6 years). Of these 8 (33{\%}) were males and 16 (67{\%}) females. The following methods of examination were used: computed tomography (CT) of the thigh musculature--linear measurement and area of the cross-section of the vastus medialis muscle; electromyography--muscle fiber conduction velocity; and measurement of thigh girth. RESULTS: Significant reduction of the cross-section area and linear measurement of the vastus medialis muscle and significant delay of the muscle fiber conduction velocity was found in the symptomatic side compared with the asymptomatic side. No correlation was found between the tape measure of the thigh and cross-section area of the muscle. A significant correlation was found between the cross-section area of the muscle and the fast fiber conduction velocity as well as between the linear measurement of the vastus medialis muscle cross-section and fast fiber conduction velocity. CONCLUSION: The correlation between the macromorphological changes of the vastus medialis muscle assessed by computed tomography and the functional changes detected by electromyography allows the conclusion that the muscle fiber conduction velocity can be used as an objective method of evaluation of muscle atrophy in degenerative joint diseases.},

abstract = {The integrate-and-fire neuron model describes the state of a neuron in terms of its membrane potential, which is determined by the synaptic inputs and the injected current that the neuron receives. When the membrane potential reaches a threshold, an action potential (spike) is generated. This review considers the model in which the synaptic input varies periodically and is described by an inhomogeneous Poisson process, with both current and conductance synapses. The focus is on the mathematical methods that allow the output spike distribution to be analyzed, including first passage time methods and the Fokker-Planck equation. Recent interest in the response of neurons to periodic input has in part arisen from the study of stochastic resonance, which is the noise-induced enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio. Networks of integrate-and-fire neurons behave in a wide variety of ways and have been used to model a variety of neural, physiological, and psychological phenomena. The properties of the integrate-and-fire neuron model with synaptic input described as a temporally homogeneous Poisson process are reviewed in an accompanying paper (Burkitt in Biol Cybern, 2006).},

abstract = {Corticomuscular synchronization has been shown to occur in beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma range (30-45 Hz) during isometric compensation of static and dynamic (periodically modulated) low-level forces, respectively. However, it is still unknown to what extent these synchronization processes in beta and gamma range are modified with increasing modulated force. We addressed this question by investigating the corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) from the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) as well as the cortical and muscular spectral power during a visuomotor task where different levels of a dynamic (modulated) force were used. Seven healthy right-handed female subjects compensated dynamic forces at 8, 16, and 24{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) isometrically with their right index finger. Under the three conditions investigated, we found a broad-band CMC comprising both beta and gamma range and peaking at approximately 22 Hz within the beta band. This broad-band coherence increased linearly with higher force level. A separate analysis of the gamma range CMC did not show significant modulation of the CMC by the force levels. EEG and EMG spectral power did not show any significant difference among the three force conditions. Our results favor the view that the function of beta range CMC is not specific for low-level static forces only. The sensorimotor system may resort to stronger and also broader beta-range CMC to generate stable corticospinal interaction during increased force level, as well as when compensating for dynamic modulated forces. This finding re-enforces the importance of the beta-range EEG-EMG coherence in sensorimotor integration.},

abstract = {Studies were undertaken in normal subjects to determine whether it is possible for oligosynaptic reflex pathways to affect motoneuron discharge in the ankle jerk and H-reflex of the soleus. It is argued that if the rising phase of the increase in excitability of the soleus motoneuron pool produced by tendon percussion or by electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve lasts more than a few milliseconds and if the increase in excitability takes several milliseconds to reach the threshold for motoneuron discharge, these reflexes are unlikely to be exclusively monosynaptic. In relaxed subjects, changes in excitability of the soleus motoneuron pool produced by tendon percussion and by electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve were examined using conditioning stimuli just below threshold and a test H-reflex just above threshold for a reflex response. The increase in excitability due to tendon percussion had an average rise time of 10.8 ms and a total duration of approximately 25 ms. With electrical stimulation the rising phase appeared shorter, but it could not be measured accurately due to afferent refractoriness. In single motor units, the rise times of the composite excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) set up by subthreshold tendon percussion and by subthreshold electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve were estimated from changes in the probability of discharge of voluntarily activated single motor units. Rise times were significantly longer with tendon percussion (mean +/- SD, 7.1 +/- 2.3 ms; n = 34) than with electrical stimulation (2.4 +/- 1.4 ms; n = 32). In four experiments in which a number of motor units were studied using identical mechanical and identical electrical stimuli, the poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for each stimulus were pooled to provide an estimate of the rise time of the excitability change in the motoneuron pool. The mean rise times of these four samples were 10.5 ms with mechanical stimulation and 4.5 ms with electrical stimulation. The spontaneous variability in latency of reflexly activated single motor units was 0.8-3.1 ms (average SD, 0.34 ms) in the tendon jerk, and 0.6-1.4 ms (average SD, 0.19 ms) in the H-reflex. Comparison of these figures with the measurements of rise time given above suggests that the composite EPSPs are larger than the background synaptic noise. With six motor units, the timing of reflex discharge in the tendon jerk when the subject was relaxed was compared with the timing of the change in probability of discharge due to apparently identical percussion when the units were activated voluntarily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {While muscle spindles play a prominent role in current theories of human motor control, Golgi tendon organs (GTO) and their associated tendons are often neglected. This is surprising since there is ample evidence that both tendons and GTOs contribute importantly to neuro-musculoskeletal dynamics. Using detailed musculoskeletal models we provide evidence that simple feedback using muscle spindles alone results in very poor control of joint position and movement since muscle spindles cannot sense changes in tendon length that occur with changes in muscle force. We propose that a combination of spindle and GTO afferents can provide an estimate of muscle-tendon-complex length, which can be effectively used for low-level feedback during both postural and movement tasks. The feasibility of the proposed scheme was tested using detailed musculoskeletal models of the human arm. Responses to transient and static perturbations were simulated using a 1 DOF model of the arm and showed that the combined feedback enabled the system to respond faster, reach steady state faster, and achieve smaller static position errors. Finally, we incorporated the proposed scheme in an optimally controlled 2 DOF model of the arm for fast point-to-point shoulder and elbow movements. Simulations showed that the proposed feedback could be easily incorporated in the optimal control framework without complicating the computation of the optimal control solution, yet greatly enhancing the system's response to perturbations. The theoretical analyses in this study might furthermore provide insight about the strong physiological couplings found between muscle spindle and GTO afferents in the human nervous system.},

abstract = {When electrical stimulation is applied over human muscle, the evoked force is generally considered to be of peripheral origin. However, in relaxed humans, stimulation (1 msec pulses, 100 Hz) over the muscles that plantarflex the ankle produced more than five times more force than could be accounted for by peripheral properties. This additional force was superimposed on the direct response to motor axon stimulation, produced up to 40{\%} of the force generated during a maximal voluntary contraction, and was abolished during anesthesia of the tibial nerve proximal to the stimulation site. It therefore must have resulted from the activation of motoneurons within the spinal cord. The additional force could be initiated by stimulation of low-threshold afferents, distorted the classical relationship between force and stimulus frequency, and often outlasted the stimulation. The mean firing rate of 27 soleus motor units recorded during the sustained involuntary activity after the stimulation was 5.8 +/- 0.2 Hz. The additional force increments were not attributable to voluntary intervention because they were present in three sleeping subjects and in two subjects with lesions of the thoracic spinal cord. The phenomenon is consistent with activation of plateau potentials within motoneurons and, if so, the present findings imply that plateau potentials can make a large contribution to forces produced by the human nervous system.},

abstract = {At present there is a lack of consensus regarding the relative roles of passive and active control of quiet upright stance. In the current work, this issue was investigated using two simulation models based on contemporary theories. Specifically, the two models, both of which assumed active control torques to be generated from an optimal neural controller, differed with respect to whether or not passive control torques (stiffness and damping) were included. Model parameters were specified using experimental center-of-pressure (COP) time series obtained during upright stance, and comparisons then made between simulated and actual COP-based measures. Including both active and passive joint torques in the control model did not appear to lead to any improvement in the ability to simulate COP compared with only including active joint torque. Further, simulated passive control torques were typically less than 10{\%} of the active control torques, though some exceptions were found. These results, along with existing empirical evidence, suggest that active control torque is dominant in maintaining balance during upright stance.},

abstract = {This study compared motor unit rate coding and muscular force control in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of older ( n = 11, mean 72.3 yr) and young ( n = 12, mean 18.7 yr) adults. Rate coding during a sinusoidal isometric force-matching task was evaluated using spectral analysis of the time- varying changes in firing rate. The task required force modulations to match a trajectory comprising the sum of 0.15- and 0.45- Hz sine waves. Based on the amplitude of spectral peaks at 0.15 and 0.45 Hz, the amplitude of force modulation was similar in young and older adults at both frequencies ( F = 1.9, P = 0.17). Force modulation gain ( FMG) was computed as the ratio of the amplitude of force modulation to the amplitude of firing rate modulation. To account for rate coding differences related to the properties of the motoneuron, recruitment threshold force was used as a covariate in age- group comparisons. At both task frequencies, firing rate was modulated with less amplitude ( F = 0 14, P < 0.001) and FMG was greater ( F = 0 27, P < 0.001) in the older adults. In its transformation of neural input to mechanical output, muscle is known to act as a low- pass filter. Compared with modulation at 0.15 Hz, less change in force per change in firing rate at 0.45 Hz ( lower FMG; F = 0 67, P < 0.001), independent of age group, is consistent with this filtering effect. Our conclusion is that there is a reduced amplitude of firing rate modulation in older adults.},

abstract = {Muscle force is modulated by varying the number of active motor units and their firing rates. For the past five decades, the notion that the magnitude of the firing rates is directly related to motor unit size and recruitment threshold has been widely accepted. This construct, here named the After-hyperpolarization scheme evolved from observations in electrically stimulated cat motoneurons and from reported observations in voluntary contractions in humans. It supports the assumption that the firing rates of motor units match their mechanical properties to "optimize" force production, so that the firing rate range corresponds to that required for force-twitch fusion (tetanization) and effective graduation of muscle force. In contrast, we have shown that, at any time and force during isometric voluntary constant-force contractions in humans, the relationship between firing rate and recruitment threshold is inversely related. We refer to this construct as the Onion-Skin scheme because earlier-recruited motor units always have greater firing rates than latter-recruited ones. By applying a novel mathematical model that calculates the force produced by a muscle for the two schemes we found that the Onion-Skin scheme is more energy efficient, provides smoother muscle force at low to moderate force levels, and appears to be more conducive to evolutionary survival than the After-hyperpolarization scheme.},

abstract = {A vertebrate motoneuron receives an enormous amount of synaptic activity from descending pathways, from spinal cord interneurons and directly from mechanoreceptor afferents. The intrinsic characteristics of the motoneuron will determine how its output spike train will encode the activities of all its inputs. Therefore, the essence of the intrinsic motoneuron characteristics should be well studied and modelled if the roles of the motoneuron as a processing or encoding element are to be well understood. Mathematical models of motoneurons have been described in the literature and tested mostly under static conditions. To increase the reality of the validation of such models, the objective of the present work is to test a few selected models described in the literature using sinusoidal injected current of different frequencies. The resulting frequency responses are compared with data available in the literature from cat type F motoneurons. Discrepancies between some of the models' responses and real motoneuron data suggest that improvements are needed in the modelling of the afterhyperpolarization mechanism.

@article{Druckmann2008,
abstract = {Neuron models, in particular conductance-based compartmental models, often have numerous parameters that cannot be directly determined experimentally and must be constrained by an optimization procedure. A common practice in evaluating the utility of such procedures is using a previously developed model to generate surrogate data (e.g., traces of spikes following step current pulses) and then challenging the algorithm to recover the original parameters (e.g., the value of maximal ion channel conductances) that were used to generate the data. In this fashion, the success or failure of the model fitting procedure to find the original parameters can be easily determined. Here we show that some model fitting procedures that provide an excellent fit in the case of such model-to-model comparisons provide ill-balanced results when applied to experimental data. The main reason is that surrogate and experimental data test different aspects of the algorithm's function. When considering model-generated surrogate data, the algorithm is required to locate a perfect solution that is known to exist. In contrast, when considering experimental target data, there is no guarantee that a perfect solution is part of the search space. In this case, the optimization procedure must rank all imperfect approximations and ultimately select the best approximation. This aspect is not tested at all when considering surrogate data since at least one perfect solution is known to exist (the original parameters) making all approximations unnecessary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that distance functions based on extracting a set of features from the target data (such as time-to-first-spike, spike width, spike frequency, etc.)-rather than using the original data (e.g., the whole spike trace) as the target for fitting-are capable of finding imperfect solutions that are good approximations of the experimental data.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of patella taping in normal subjects. Previous work has established positive effects of patella taping on patellofemoral pain syndrome patients, but the mode of action remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that taping brings about subtle changes in the internal physiological environment of the joint. It could be expected that in normal joints taping would bring about a measurable change in function, as the joint is no longer operating in an optimal physiological environment. 10 normal female subject's (21.4 +/- 1.2 years) vastus medialis oblique (VMO) and vastus laterialis (VL) EMG activity and knee kinematics (peak stance flexion angle and angular velocity) were assessed during a step descent, with and without a taped patella. The effect of taping was to significantly decrease VMO and VL EMG activity. Taping also significantly reduced peak stance phase knee flexion and peak stance phase knee flexion angular velocity. In normal asymptomatic subjects patella taping created a situation in which their performance was changed to one similar to that of the pathological patellofemoral pain syndrome population. It would appear that taping caused the joint to function sub-optimally supporting the hypothesis that taping could change the functioning of the patellofemoral joint. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Architectural values are used to model muscle-joint behavior and to make surgical decisions. The two most extensively used human lower extremity data sets consist of five total specimens of unknown size, gender, and age. Therefore, it is critically important to generate a high-fidelity human lower extremity muscle architecture data set. We disassembled 27 muscles from 21 human lower extremities to characterize muscle fiber length and physiologic cross-sectional area, which define the excursion and force-generating capacities of a muscle. Based on their architectural features, the soleus, gluteus medius, and vastus lateralis are the strongest muscles, whereas the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus have the largest excursion. The plantarflexors, knee extensors, and hip adductors are the strongest muscle groups acting at each joint, whereas the hip adductors and hip extensors have the largest excursion. Contrary to previous assertions, two-joint muscles do not necessarily have longer fibers than single-joint muscles as seen by the similarity of knee flexor and extensor fiber lengths. These high-resolution data will facilitate the development of more accurate musculoskeletal models and challenge existing theories of muscle design; we believe they will aid in surgical decision making.},

abstract = {Bifurcation mechanisms involved in the generation of action potentials (spikes) by neurons are reviewed here. We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it call fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing. We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend the existing classification of bursters, including many new types. We discuss how the type of burster defines its neuro-computational properties, and we show that different bursters can interact, synchronize and process information differently.},

@article{Nickolls2004,
abstract = {Percutaneous electrical stimulation over tibialis anterior and triceps surae was performed in 14 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) to look for evidence that 'extra contractions' can develop, beyond those due to activation of the motor axons beneath the stimulating electrodes. Criteria for the extra contractions included marked asymmetry of force with respect to stimulation, progressively rising force during stimulation of constant amplitude and frequency, and force remaining high after stimulation frequency had returned to the control level following a high-frequency burst. Twelve of the 14 patients showed evidence of such behaviour, more frequently in triceps surae than tibialis anterior. Force or electromyographic activity commonly outlasted the stimulation in these patients. There was no apparent correlation between the completeness or level of injury and the ability to induce the behaviour. Evidence of force potentiation and 'habituation' was also seen. Eleven of the 14 patients exhibited hyper-reflexia and reported spontaneous spasms, but there was no obvious association with the extra contractions. It is concluded that non-classical behaviour of neurons within the spinal cord can contribute to the extra contractions evoked by electrical stimulation over muscles in spinal cord-injured subjects. This central contribution is less easy to obtain than in intact healthy subjects, all of whom showed the phenomenon. These contractions are consistent with the activation of plateau potentials in spinal neurons and, if so, plateau potentials may contribute to a patient's clinical manifestations.},

Severe loss in force was seen in both muscles, and slow (S) motor units (MUs) within the MG showed about the same susceptibility as fast (FF) units. Both muscles and isolated fast and slow MUs within the MG exhibited an initial spike of tension and throughout stimulation a low level of residual tension. Despite the minimal output of work, a contribution to fatigue could be detected in the poststimulation period, as well as a delayed facilitative effect. Possible mechanisms are discussed.},

This Wiener model contains three sections: a single-input multi-output linear with memory system, a multi-input, multi-output nonlinear no-memory system and a multi-input, single-output amplification and summary system. For Gaussian white input signal, because of the orthogonality of the Q-polynomial, the autocorrelation matrix can be diagonalizable which allows us to apply LMS algorithm without any difficulty. This result can also be extended easily to LMF algorithm family. If we apply RLS, the faster convergence speed can be expected. In certain circumstances, the nonlinear Wiener model allows us to identify a complicated Volterra system with only very few terms but still keep the linear filtering properties which means that we can achieve good performance without sacrificing the computation complexity.},

abstract = {Two compartmental models of spinal alpha motoneurons were constructed to explore the relationship between background firing rate and response to an excitatory input. The results of these simulations were compared with previous results obtained from human motoneurons and discussed in relation to the current model for repetitively firing human motoneurons. The morphologies and cable parameters of the models were based on two type-identified cat motoneurons previously reported in the literature. Each model included five voltage-dependent channels that were modeled using Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. These included fast Na+ and K+ channels in the initial segment and fast Na+ and K+ channels as well as a slow K+ channel in the soma compartment. The density and rate factors for the slow K+ channel were varied until the models could reproduce single spike AHP parameters for type-identified motoneurons in the cat. Excitatory synaptic conductances were distributed along the equivalent dendrites with the same density described for 1a synapses from muscle spindles to type-identified cat motoneurons. Simultaneous activation of all synapses on the dendrite resulted in a large compound excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Brief depolarizing pulses injected into a compartment of the equivalent dendrite resulted in pulse potentials (PPs), which resembled the compound EPSPs. The effects of compound EPSPs and PPs on firing probability of the two motoneuron models were examined during rhythmic firing. Peristimulus time histograms, constructed between the stimulus and the spikes of the model motoneuron, showed excitatory peaks whose integrated time course approximated the time course of the underlying EPSP or PP as has been shown in cat motoneurons. The excitatory peaks were quantified in terms of response probability, and the relationship between background firing rate and response probability was explored. As in real human motoneurons, the models exhibited an inverse relationship between response probability and background firing rate. The biophysical properties responsible for the relationship between response probability and firing rate included the shapes of the membrane voltage trajectories between spikes and nonlinear changes in PP amplitude during the interspike interval at different firing rates. The results from these simulations suggest that the relationship between response probability and background firing rate is an intrinsic feature of motoneurons. The similarity of the results from the models, which were based on the properties of cat motoneurons, and those from human motoneurons suggests that the biophysical properties governing rhythmic firing in human motoneurons are similar to those of the cat.},

abstract = {Many studies have addressed corticomuscular coherence (CMC), but broad applications are limited by low coherence values and the variability across subjects and recordings. Here, we investigated how the use of high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) can improve the detection of CMC. Sixteen healthy subjects performed isometric contractions at six low-force levels using a pinch-grip, while HDsEMG of the adductor pollicis transversus and flexor and abductor pollicis brevis and whole-head magnetoencephalography were recorded. Different configurations were constructed from the HDsEMG grid, such as a bipolar and Laplacian montage, as well as a montage based on principal component analysis (PCA). CMC was estimated for each configuration, and the strength of coherence was compared across configurations. As expected, performance of the precision-grip task resulted in significant CMC in the $\beta$-frequency band (16-26 Hz). Compared with a bipolar EMG montage, all multichannel configurations obtained from the HDsEMG grid revealed a significant increase in CMC. The configuration, based on PCA, showed the largest (37{\{}{\%}{\}}) increase. HDsEMG did not reduce the between-subject variability; rather, many configurations showed an increased coefficient of variation. Increased CMC presumably reflects the ability of HDsEMG to counteract inherent EMG signal factors-such as amplitude cancellation-which impact the detection of oscillatory inputs. In contrast, the between-subject variability of CMC most likely has a cortical origin.},

An influence of various model parameters on the relationship between standard deviation (SD), sigma, of interspike intervals (ISIs) and their mean value, T-m, was studied. A typical sigma(T-m) relationship resembled those obtained experimentally and consisted of two parts: a short-interval part with constant sigma and a long-interval part where a increased linearly with increasing ISI. It is concluded that the placement of the range of transition between short- and long-interval parts of the plot depends on the properties of the motoneuron and not on those of the synaptic inflow. The break-point interval of the plot is correlated with the AHP duration but is shorter than it. Further, not only are the curves for shorter AHP durations shifted towards shorter ISIs, but they also have lower SDs at their short-interval parts. (C) Elsevier, Paris.},

abstract = {Human balance is commonly described using linear-time-invariant (LTI) models. The feedback time delay determines the position of balance in the motor-control hierarchy. The extent of LTI control illuminates the automaticity of the control process. Using non-parametric analysis, we measured the feedback delay, extent of LTI control and visuo-motor transfer function in six randomly disturbed, visuo-manual compensatory tracking tasks analogous to standing with small mechanical perturbations and purely visual information. The delay depended primarily on load order (2nd: 220+/-30 ms, 1st: 124+/-20 ms), and secondarily on visual magnification (extent 2nd: 34 ms, 1st: 8 ms) and was unaffected by load stability. LTI control explained 1st order and stable loads relatively well. For unstable (85{\{}{\%}{\}} passive stabilisation) 2nd order loads, LTI control accounted for 40{\{}{\%}{\}} of manual output at 0.1 Hz decreasing below 10{\{}{\%}{\}} as frequency increased through the important 1-3 Hz region where manual power and visuo-motor gain are high. Visual control of unstable 2nd order loads incurs substantial feedback delays and the control process will not be LTI. These features do not result from exclusive use of visual inputs because we found much shorter delays and a greater degree of LTI control when subjects visually controlled a 1st order load. Rather, these results suggest that delay and variability are inevitable when more flexible, intentional mechanisms are required to control 2nd order unstable loads. The high variability of quiet standing, and movement generally, may be indicative of flexible, variable delay, intentional mechanisms rather than the automatic LTI responses usually reported in response to large perturbations.},

@article{Rafuse1992,
abstract = {1. To determine the capacity of motoneurons to increase their motor unit (MU) size by collateral sprouting and to assess this capacity in relation to the size of the motor nerve, we partially denervated soleus, lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles in adult and neonatal cats. Isometric force and extracellular nerve potentials were recorded from greater-than-or-equal-to 7{\%} of the remaining MUs, 2.5-18 mo later. S1 or L7 roots were sectioned unilaterally and the number of remaining MUs was quantified by use of charge and force measurements. 2. The mean unit force increased inversely with MU number in partially denervated muscles, but the increase was less than predicted for extensive denervations (greater-than-or-equal-to 90{\%}). The same enlargement of MU size occurred whether muscles were partially denervated in neonatal or adult animals. 3. The force distribution of MUs in partially denervated muscles was similar to normal but was shifted to larger force values in direct proportion to the extent of partial denervation (PD). All MUs increased in size by the same factor to preserve the normal force distribution. 4. Normal size relationships among force, contractile speed, and axon potential amplitude were observed for MUs in partially denervated muscles. Because changes in muscle fiber size could not account for the increase in unit force, these data show that increase in MU size, with respect to unit force and innervation ratio (muscle fibers per motoneuron), is proportional to the size of the motor nerve. 5. Enlargement of MU size in partially denervated muscles did not have a retrograde effect on nerve fiber caliber because axon potential amplitude and conduction velocity were not changed after PD. 6. Under conditions of extensive PD (>85{\%}), regenerated nerves from the cut spinal root reinnervated the gastrocnemius muscles. It is likely that nerves supplied muscle fibers that were not innervated by sprouts from nerves in the uncut root as well as displacing sprouts from terminals in extensively enlarged MUs. 7. We conclude that all motoneurons within a motor pool compensate for partial nerve injuries by collateral sprouting and that enlargement of MU size is a function of motor nerve size, consistent with Henneman's size principle.},

abstract = {We have investigated whether peripheral afferent fibers could encode the central oscillations that are commonly seen in the primate motor system. We analyzed 52 single afferent recordings from the C8/T1 dorsal root ganglia of two monkeys performing an isometric wrist flexion-extension task. Coherence and directed coherence were calculated between the afferent spikes and forearm EMG. Seven of 52 cells were identified as Group Ia afferents by the production of narrow postspike facilitation in spike-triggered averages of rectified EMG. These identified afferents showed significant coherence, and directed coherence, with EMG over a wide frequency range. By contrast, coherence was weak for a population that showed little directional preference for flexion or extension movements during task performance, and probably contained mainly cutaneous afferents. Oscillations are known to appear in muscle activity; their presence in afferent firing as well implies that central oscillations pass around a peripheral feedback loop and may be involved in sensorimotor integration.},

abstract = {In quasi-sinusoidal (0.5-3.0 Hz) voluntary muscle contractions, we studied the 6- to 10-Hz motor unit (MU) firing synchrony and muscle force oscillation with emphasis on their neural substrate and relation to rhythmical motor control. Our analyses were performed on data from 121 contractions of a finger muscle in 24 human subjects. They demonstrate that coherent 6- to 10-Hz components of MU discharges coexist with carrier components and coherent modulation components underlying the voluntary force variations. The 6- to 10-Hz synchrony has the frequency of the tremor synchrony in steady contractions and is also widespread and in-phase. Its strength ranges from very small to very large (MU/MU coherence >0.50) among contractions; moreover, it is not related to the contraction parameters, in accord with the notion of a distinct 6- to 10-Hz synaptic input to the MUs. Unlike the coherent MU modulations and the voluntary force variations, the in-phase 6- to 10-Hz MU components are suppressed or even eliminated during ischemia, while the respective force component is drastically reduced. These findings agree with the widely assumed supraspinal origin of the MU modulations, but they also strongly suggest a key role for muscle spindle feedback in the generation of the 6- to 10-Hz synaptic input. They therefore provide important information for the study of generators of the 6- to 10-Hz rhythm which subserves the postulated rhythmical control and is manifested as force and movement components. Moreover, they argue for a participation of oscillating spinal stretch reflex loops in the rhythm generation, possibly in interaction with supraspinal oscillators.},

abstract = {1. The effects of different types of synaptic input on the steady-state input-output relations of the mammalian motoneuron pool were investigated by the use of computer simulations. The properties of the simulated motor units and their synaptic inputs were based as closely as possible on the experimental data from studies in the cat hindlimb. 2. Three basic types of synaptic input systems were simulated: postsynaptic, presynaptic, and neuromodulatory. The effects of these inputs on three aspects of the system input-output structure were studied: gain, precision, and motor-unit type utilization. 3. The gain analyses were based on a simulation of the steady-state homonymous Is input. The gain of this steady-state Ia ''reflex'' was found to be determined largely by the slope of the pool input-output function. Precision was evaluated in two ways, from the amplitudes of the quantal steps due to motor-unit recruitment and from the sensitivity of the input-output function to noise. The pattern of motor-unit type utilization allowed indirect assessment of fatigue resistance: the larger the percentage of force generated by FF units, the lower the fatigue resistance. 4. A uniformly distributed input (i.e., one that generates equal input in all motoneurons) generates outputs that are solely determined by the intrinsic properties of the motor units. Thus the gain, precision, and motor-unit type patterns generated by a uniform input were used as the basis with which the effects of all other input systems were compared. 5. Postsynaptic excitatory inputs with nonuniform distributions within the pool did influence gain. The greatest effect was the increase mediated by the rubrospinal excitatory input (27{\%} increase at 30{\%} of maximal force). However, this input also greatly decreased both fatigue resistance and precision, due to increased activation of FF units at low force levels. In contrast, the Ia input slightly decreased gain ( 12{\%} decrease at 30{\%} of maximum force) while slightly increasing fatigue resistance and precision. 6. The simulated neuromodulatory input was based on the monoaminergic reticulospinal effect on motoneurons. Gain was generally increased by the monoaminergic input. However, the magnitude of the increase strongly depended on whether the monoaminergic effects were largest on S units (giving a 20{\%} increase at 30{\%} of maximum force), equal on all types (52{\%}), or largest on FF units (102{\%}). Presynaptic inhibition reduced gain with no effect whatsoever on fatigue resistance or precision. 7. Therefore Ia reflex gain was modifiable by all three types of input: postsynaptic, presynaptic, and neuromodulatory. However, the presynaptic inhibition and neuromodulatory inputs potentially had much greater effects on gain than did the postsynaptic inputs and, moreover, had much less effect on fatigue resistance and precision. This suggests that postsynaptic inputs are not normally used for flexible gain control but may instead be used to optimize the gain, fatigue, and precision characteristics of a basic input-output function.},

abstract = {Non-technical summary In the medial gastrocnemius muscle of cats, the longitudinal size (3-4 cm) of the territory of motor units is large (similar to 60{\%}) relative to the muscle length. In the human medial gastrocnemius, the size of motor unit territories is unknown. By comparing intramuscular and surface electromyograms we show that, when subjects stand at ease, the motor units active in the medial gastrocnemius have small territories. They extend no longer than 4 cm and no less than 1 cm along the longitudinal axis (similar to 25 cm long) of the muscle. Physiologically, the small territories of motor units give the nervous system a mechanism for the independent activation of sub-volumes of the medial gastrocnemius muscle.In cat medial gastrocnemius (MG), fibres supplied by individual motoneurones (muscle units) distribute extensively along the muscle longitudinal axis. In the human MG, the size of motor unit territory is unknown. It is uncertain if the absolute size of muscle unit territory or the size relative to the whole muscle is most comparable with the cat. By comparing intramuscular and surface electromyograms we tested whether muscle units extend narrowly or widely along the human MG muscle. Due to the pennation of the MG, if individual motoneurones supply fibres scattered along the muscle, then action potentials of single motor units are expected to appear sparsely on the surface of the skin. In nine healthy subjects, pairs of wire electrodes were inserted in three locations along the MG muscle (MG(60{\%}), MG(75{\%}) and MG(90{\%})). A longitudinal array of 16 surface electrodes was positioned alongside the intramuscular electrodes. While subjects stood quietly, 55 motor units were identified, of which, significantly more units were detected in the most distal sites. The surface action potentials had maximum amplitude at 4.40 +/- 1.67 (mean +/- s.d.), 8.02 +/- 2.16 and 11.63 +/- 2.09 cm (P < 0.001) from the most proximal surface electrode, for motor units in the MG(60{\%}), MG(75{\%}) and MG(90{\%}) locations, respectively. Single motor unit potentials were recorded by five consecutive surface electrodes, at most, indicating that muscle units extend shortly along the MG longitudinal axis. It is concluded that relative to the whole muscle, and compared with the cat, muscle units in human MG are localised. The localisation of muscle units might have implications for the regional control of muscle activity.},

We recorded long spike trains from single motor units in three human muscles made to discharge at constant mean frequencies with the help of auditory and visual feedback. The distribution of interspike intervals in each spike train was analysed quantitatively. We found that the different pattern of discharge of the human motor units could be accounted for when due allowance was made for the variability of the drive to the human motoneurone which arose because of the feedback process used to maintain the target frequency. A model testing this hypothesis gave results that were qualitatively consistent with the human data.},

abstract = {We analyze the stochastic structure of postural sway and demonstrate that this structure imposes important constraints on models of postural control. Linear stochastic models of various orders were fit to the center-of-mass trajectories of subjects during quiet stance in four sensory conditions: (i) light touch and vision, (ii) light touch, (iii) vision, and (iv) neither touch nor vision. For each subject and condition, the model of appropriate order was determined, and this model was characterized by the eigenvalues and coefficients of its autocovariance function. In most cases, postural-sway trajectories were similar to those produced by a third-order model with eigenvalues corresponding to a slow first-order decay plus a faster-decaying damped oscillation. The slow-decay fraction, which we define as the slow-decay autocovariance coefficient divided by the total variance, was usually near 1. We compare the stochastic structure of our data to two linear control-theory models: (i) a proportional-integral-derivative control model in which the postural system's state is assumed to be known, and (ii) an optimal-control model in which the system's state is estimated based on noisy multisensory information using a Kalman filter. Under certain assumptions, both models have eigenvalues consistent with our results. However, the slow-decay fraction predicted by both models is less than we observe. We show that our results are more consistent with a modification of the optimal-control model in which noise is added to the computations performed by the state estimator. This modified model has a slow-decay fraction near 1 in a parameter regime in which sensory information related to the body's velocity is more accurate than sensory information related to position and acceleration. These findings suggest that: (i) computation noise is responsible for much of the variance observed in postural sway, and (ii) the postural control system under the conditions tested resides in the regime of accurate velocity information.},

The subjects stood for 30 min with no specific instructions other than not to step off a force plate. There were no significant effects on the number of centre of pressure patterns associated with the postural changes due to load, vision, surface and shoes during standing; on average, approximately two centre of pressure patterns per minute were observed in all conditions.

abstract = {In the present study, the function of the somatosensory feedback system in postural control was investigated. For the sake of simplicity, the present study considered only balancing in the anteroposterior direction using the ankle strategy, in which the ankle moment is mainly used to maintain balance. To suppress the vestibular and visual feedback paths, a subject stood on a force-measuring platform with a fixed back support, Because the subject's body was immovable under these conditions, the subject controlled a computer model that simulated the subject's load at the ankles, Information about the sway angle of the model was fed through the somatosensory feedback path. Frequency response functions of the ankle moment in response to the sway angle were calculated. The experimental results suggest that the human somatosensory feedback system has derivative characteristics and, consequently, can maintain an upright posture by itself. The results were compared with those of previous studies on vestibular and visual feedback systems, The comparison reveals that subject-to-subject variance in the somatosensory system is significantly smaller than that in the other systems. This may indicate that the somatosensory feedback is the most automatic of the systems and plays a dominant role when a subject maintains an upright posture using the ankle strategy.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the modulation of the motor neuronal pool as a function of task dynamics. Specifically, we investigated the effects of task frequency on the single motor unit discharge pattern, electromyogram (EMG) activity and effector force output. Myoelectric activity and effector force were recorded while young adults isometrically abducted their first dorsal interosseus at five sinusoidal targets (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 3 Hz and 4 Hz) and at two force levels (5{\%} and 25{\%} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)). Individual motor unit spike trains were isolated from the EMG. Auto-spectral and coherence analyses were performed on the force output, EMG and motor unit spike trains. The frequency of maximal coherence between the EMG and force output closely corresponded to the target frequency in all conditions. There was a broadband distribution of power with multiple peaks in the EMG and motor unit spectrums in the 0.5 Hz and 1 Hz targets. However, the EMG and motor unit spectrums in the 2 Hz, 3 Hz and 4 Hz targets were characterized by an increasingly narrower band of activity with one dominant peak that closely corresponded to the target. There is high coherence between EMG output and target force frequency, but the relative contribution of the fast and slow neuromuscular bands are differentially influenced by the task frequency. The rhythmical organization of neuromuscular output in the 0.5 Hz task is relatively broadband and similar to that shown previously for constant level force output. The frequency structure of neuromuscular organization becomes increasingly more narrowband as the frequency of the target increases (2-4 Hz). The modulation of the motor neuronal pool is adaptive and depends on the relative contribution of feedback and feedforward control processes, which are driven by the task demands.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether subsensory electrical noise stimulation applied over the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles may reduce postural oscillations during quiet stance and to compare such reductions with those obtained by applying the noise stimulation over the triceps surae (TS) muscles. The rationale relies on the use of noise stimulation to enhance the sensitivity of sensory receptors, thereby improving the performance of the postural control system. As recent evidence suggested that the TA muscle might be a better source of proprioceptive information during quiet stance than the TS muscles, the main hypothesis of the present study was that subsensory noise stimulation applied to the TA muscles should be more efficient for postural stabilization than a similar stimulation to the TS.

METHODS: Participants had their postural steadiness assessed while subsensory electrical noise was applied bilaterally to their TA or TS muscles and also while the stimulation was applied bilaterally to both TA and TS muscles. No stimulation was delivered in the control condition.

RESULTS: Time-domain and frequency-domain parameters based on center of mass and center of pressure signals were significantly reduced when noise stimulation was applied to the anterior and/or to the posterior leg muscles. No consistent differences in postural sway parameters were observed among the stimulation conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first investigation showing that subsensory stimulation applied over the TA muscles alone is effective in attenuating postural sway, with TS stimulation being equally effective. These findings may have useful applications for the development of medical/rehabilitation devices designed to improve postural steadiness in people with balance impairments.},

abstract = {Experiments using electrical and mechanical activation of spinal reflexes have contributed important results toward the understanding of neuronal and synaptic dynamics involved in spinal neural circuits as well as their response to different inputs. In this work, data obtained from the simultaneous stimulation of both legs are analyzed to provide information on the degree of symmetry of the respective spinal reflex circuits and on the characteristics of reflex variability. H-reflexes recorded from relaxed muscles show a frequency-dependent amplitude depression when elicited by a train of stimuli. This effect has been attributed to homosynaptic depression. Soleus H-reflexes were recorded in response to trains of simultaneous stimuli applied to both legs in right-handed subjects that were sitting in a relaxed state. The first objective was to verify the existence of asymmetries in H-reflex parameters obtained from the two legs. We measured the mean, variance, and coefficient of variation of the depressed H-reflex amplitudes and the time constant of decay toward the depressed plateau. The second objective was the analysis of the time correlation of subsequent H-reflex amplitudes in a long train of responses recorded from a given leg. The statistical dependence of H-reflex amplitudes in the long trains recorded from both legs was also investigated. Data obtained from preliminary experiments showed that there was no effect of a given stimulus on the contralateral leg applied simultaneously or 1 s before, therefore validating the simultaneous stimulation paradigm. Paired t-tests indicated that several parameters measured bilaterally from soleus H-reflex trains of right-handed subjects were not statistically different in the overall, although individually there were statistically significant asymmetries, toward either the right or left leg. Sequences of H-reflex amplitudes, as measured by the auto-covariance, were either white or had a memory ranging from 2 up to 50 s. This indicates that the random fluctuations in presynaptic inhibition and/or postsynaptic inputs to motoneurons may have either fast or slow time courses. The average auto-covariance sequences of the right and left legs, computed from all subjects, were practically superposable. The cross-covariance between the bilateral H-reflex amplitudes showed a statistically significant peak at zero lag in some experiments, suggesting a correlation between the synaptic inputs to the Ia-motoneuron systems of the soleus muscles of both legs.},

abstract = {Oscillations in local field potentials in the beta-frequency band (13-35 Hz) are a pervasive feature of human and nonhuman primate motor cortical areas. However, the function of such synchronous activity across populations of neurons remains unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that beta activity may promote existing motor set and posture while compromising processing related to new movements. Three experiments were performed. First, healthy subjects were instructed to make reaction time movements of the outstretched index finger in response to imperative cues triggered by transient increases in corticospinal synchrony, as evidenced by phasic elevations of beta-frequency band microtremor and intermuscular synchrony. Second, healthy subjects were instructed to resist a stretch to the index finger triggered in the same way. Finger acceleration in the reaction time task and transcortical components of the stretch reflex were measured and compared with those elicited by random cue or stretch presentation. Finally, we sought a correlation between finger acceleration in the reaction time task and cortical synchrony directly measured from the electrocorticogram in two patients undergoing functional neurosurgery. We demonstrate that movements are slowed and transcortical responses to stretch are potentiated during periods of elevated beta-band cortical synchrony. The results suggest that physiological periods of beta synchrony are associated with a cortical state in which postural set is reinforced, but the speed of new movements impaired. The findings are of relevance to Parkinson's disease, in which subcortical and cortical beta-band synchronization is exaggerated in the setting of increased tone and slowed movements.},

abstract = {To explore the link between bioenergetics and motor neuron degeneration, we used a computational model in which detailed morphology and ion conductance are paired with intracellular ATP production and consumption. We found that reduced ATP availability increases the metabolic cost of a single action potential and disrupts K+/Na+ homeostasis, resulting in a chronic depolarization. The magnitude of the ATP shortage at which this ionic instability occurs depends on the morphology and intrinsic conductance characteristic of the neuron. If ATP shortage is confined to the distal part of the axon, the ensuing local ionic instability eventually spreads to the whole neuron and involves fasciculation-like spiking events. A shortage of ATP also causes a rise in intracellular calcium. Our modeling work supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction can account for salient features of the paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including motor neuron hyperexcitability, fasciculation, and differential vulnerability of motor neuron subpopulations.},

abstract = {Coherence between electroencephalography (EEG) recorded on the scalp above the motor cortex and electromyography (EMG) recorded on the skin of the limbs is thought to reflect corticospinal coupling between motor cortex and muscle motor units. Beta-range (13-30 Hz) corticomuscular coherence has been extensively documented during static force output while gamma-range (31-45 Hz) coherence has been linked to dynamic force output. However, the explanation for this beta-to-gamma coherence shift remains unclear. We recorded 264-channel EEG and 8-channel lower limb EMG while eight healthy subjects performed isometric and isotonic, knee, and ankle exercises. Adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA) parsed EEG into models of underlying source signals. We computed magnitude squared coherence between electrocortical source signals and EMG. Significant coherence between contralateral motor cortex electrocortical signals and lower limb EMG was observed in the beta- and gamma-range for all exercise types. Gamma-range coherence was significantly greater for isotonic exercises than for isometric exercises. We conclude that active muscle movement modulates the speed of corticospinal oscillations. Specifically, isotonic contractions shift corticospinal oscillations toward the gamma-range while isometric contractions favor beta-range oscillations. Prior research has suggested that tasks requiring increased integration of visual and somatosensory information may shift corticomuscular coherence to the gamma-range. The isometric and isotonic tasks studied here likely required similar amounts of visual and somatosensory integration. This suggests that muscle dynamics, including the amount and type of proprioception, may play a role in the beta-to-gamma shift.},

abstract = {The dorsal-side-up body posture of standing quadrupeds is maintained by coordinated activity of all limbs. Somatosensory input from the limbs evokes postural responses when the supporting surface is perturbed. The aim of this study was to reveal the contribution of sensory inputs from individual limbs to the posture-related modulation of pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) arising in the primary motor cortex. We recorded the activity of PTNs from the limb representation of motor cortex in the cat maintaining balance on a platform periodically tilted in the frontal plane. Each PTN was recorded during standing on four limbs, and when two or three limbs were lifted from the platform and thus did not signal its displacement to motor cortex. By comparing PTN responses to tilts in different tests we found that the amplitude and the phase of the response in the majority of them were determined primarily by the sensory input from the corresponding contralateral limb. In a portion of PTNs, this input originated from afferents of the peripheral receptive field. Sensory input from the ipsilateral limb, as well as input from limbs of the other girdle made a much smaller contribution to the PTN modulation. These results show that, during postural activity, a key role of PTNs is the feedback control of the corresponding contralateral limb and, to a lesser extent, the coordination of posture within a girdle and between the two girdles.},

This system detects imaginary dorsiflexion movements within a short latency from scalp EEG through the analysis of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs). A manifold-based method, called locality preserving projection, detected the motor imagery online with a true positive rate of 73.0 ± 10.3{\{}{\%}{\}}. Each detection triggered the MAFO to elicit a passive dorsiflexion. In nine healthy subjects, the size of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation increased significantly immediately following and 30 min after the cessation of this BCI-MAFO intervention for ∼15 min ( p = 0.009 and , respectively), indicating neural plasticity. In four subjects, the size of the short latency stretch reflex component did not change following the intervention, suggesting that the site of the induced plasticity was cortical. All but one subject also performed two control conditions where they either imagined only or where the MAFO was randomly triggered. Both of these control conditions resulted in no significant changes in MEP size ( p = 0.38 and p = 0.15 ). The proposed system provides a fast and effective approach for inducing cortical plasticity through BCI and has potential in motor function rehabilitation following stroke.},

abstract = {This paper examined if an electromyography (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model of the human knee could be used to predict knee moments, calculated using inverse dynamics, across a varied range of dynamic contractile conditions. Muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms of 13 muscles crossing the knee joint were determined from joint kinematics using a three-dimensional anatomical model of the lower limb. Muscle activation was determined using a second-order discrete non-linear model using rectified and low-pass filtered EMG as input. A modified Hill-type muscle model was used to calculate individual muscle forces using activation and muscle tendon lengths as inputs. The model was calibrated to six individuals by altering a set of physiologically based parameters using mathematical optimisation to match the net flexion/extension (FE) muscle moment with those measured by inverse dynamics. The model was calibrated for each subject using 5 different tasks, including passive and active FE in an isokinetic dynamometer, running. and cutting manoeuvres recorded using three-dimensional motion analysis. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the FE moments, estimated via inverse dynamics, from over 200 isokinetic dynamometer, running and sidestepping tasks. The inverse dynamics joint moments were predicted with an average R-2 of 0.91 and mean residual error of similar to12 Nm. A re-calibration of only the EMG-to-activation parameters revealed FE moments prediction across weeks of similar accuracy. Changing the muscle model to one that is more physiologically correct produced better predictions. The modelling method presented represents a good way to estimate in vivo muscle forces during movement tasks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Synchronization of neural activity is considered essential for information processing in the nervous system. Both local and inter-regional synchronization are omnipresent in different frequency regimes and relate to a variety of behavioral and cognitive functions. Over the years, many studies have sought to elucidate the question how alpha/mu, beta, and gamma synchronization contribute to motor control. Here, we review these studies with the purpose to delineate what they have added to our understanding of the neural control of movement. We highlight important findings regarding oscillations in primary motor cortex, synchronization between cortex and spinal cord, synchronization between cortical regions, as well as abnormal synchronization patterns in a selection of motor dysfunctions. The interpretation of synchronization patterns benefits from combining results of invasive and non-invasive recordings, different data analysis tools, and modeling work. Importantly, although synchronization is deemed to play a vital role, it is not the only mechanism for neural communication. Spike timing and rate coding act together during motor control and should therefore both be accounted for when interpreting movement-related activity.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The usefulness of surface EMG for assessing motor output variability during steady contraction is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the temporal correlation in signal characteristics between low-frequency components of full-wave rectified EMG (with or without high-pass filtering before rectification) and force fluctuations or the instantaneous rate of force fluctuations (dF/dt) during steady contractions. METHODS: Fourteen young adults produced steady force with the first dorsal interosseus muscle at various intensities. Cross-correlation functions were calculated between the following signals: <5 Hz: force, dF/dt, and rectified EMG with or without high-pass filtering at 300 Hz before rectification. RESULTS: Rectified EMG correlated better with dF/dt compared with force itself, and high-pass filtering of interference EMG before rectification improved the temporal correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The low-frequency component of rectified EMG following high-pass filtering may provide temporal information on the instantaneous rate of force fluctuations during steady contractions.},

Because humans are bipeds with about 2/3 of their mass located 2/3 of body height from the ground the control system is critical. In the elderly balance control degenerates. Falls represent a major health problem and the fear of falls is the major deterrent to daily mobility. Many measures have evolved to assess balance, varying from crude balance tasks to sophisticated perturbations. This paper summarizes the balance control task as it relates to standing and walking and details current assessment techniques and equipment. Additional information is provided by the authors to demonstrate from an electromyographical and biomechanical perspective the mechanisms and characteristics of the postural control system in both standing and walking.},

abstract = {Modeling of muscle architecture, which aims to recreate mathematically the physiological structure of the muscle fibers and motor units, is a powerful tool for understanding and modeling the mechanical and electrical behavior of the muscle. Most of the published models are presented in the form of algorithms, without mathematical analysis of mechanisms or outcomes of the model. Through the study of the muscle architecture model proposed by Stashuk, we present the analytical tools needed to better understand these models. We provide a statistical description for the spatial relations between motor units and muscle fibers. We are particularly concerned with two physiological quantities: the motor unit fiber number, which we expect to be proportional to the motor unit territory area: and the motor unit fiber density, which we expect to be constant for all motor units. Our results indicate that the Stashuk model is in good agreement with the physiological evidence in terms of the expectations outlined above. However, the resulting variance is very high. In addition. a considerable 'edge effect' is present in the outer zone of the muscle cross-section. making the properties of the motor units dependent on their location. This effect is relevant when motor unit territories and muscle cross-section are of similar size. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many concepts in neuromuscular physiology can be difficult for instructors to teach and for students to understand. The behaviors of various components in neuromuscular systems do not always interact in obvious ways, and the function of hundreds of components can be very different from the function of just one or two "representatives." In this paper, a simulator is presented that can model both small and large spinal circuitry systems thus allowing students to explore the dynamic functional implications of the static circuitry diagrams that are common in many neuroscience textbooks. The simulator brings to life many concepts in neuromuscular physiology and permits students to explore such concepts without extensive supervision. The benefits and drawbacks of using this kind of simulator in the classroom are discussed, based on initial field tests with undergraduate and graduate students as well as input from the literature. It was found that such a simulation can be very useful as a teaching tool if it is used properly with the right audience.},

abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

abstract = {Time- and frequency-domain measures of discharge times for pairs of motor units are used to infer the proportion of common synaptic input received by motor neurons. The physiological mechanisms that can produce the experimentally observed peaks in the cross-correlation histogram and the coherence spectrum are uncertain. The present study used a computational model to impose synchronization on the discharge times of motor units. Randomly selected discharge times of a unit that was being synchronized to a reference unit were aligned with some of the discharge times of the reference unit, provided the original discharge time was within 30 ms of the discharge by the reference unit. All time-domain measures (indexes CIS, E, and k') were sensitive to changes in the level of imposed motor-unit synchronization (P < 0.01). In addition, synchronization caused a peak between 16 and 32 Hz in the coherence spectrum. The shape of the cross-correlogram determined the frequency at which the peak occurred in the coherence spectrum. Further, the magnitude of the coherence peak was highly correlated with the time-domain measures of motor-unit synchronization (r2 > 0.80), with the highest correlation occurring for index E (r2 = 0.98). Thus the peak in the 16- to 32-Hz band of the coherence spectrum can be caused by the time that individual discharges are advanced or delayed to produce synchrony. Although the in vivo processes that adjust the timing of motor-unit discharges are not fully understood, these results suggest that they may not depend entirely on an oscillatory drive by the CNS.},

abstract = {A systems model of spinal neuro-musculo-skeletal system (alpha - gamma model) is,developed to investigate the plausible roles of spinal proprioceptive feedback in movement control. The model is composed of a joint, a pair of antagonist muscles, length and velocity feedback from muscle spindle, as well as spinal stretch reflex, reciprocal inhibition and recurrent inhibition of Renshaw cells. A descending command modulates the background activation of a motoneuron pools in combination with these reflex activities. A static gamma command controls the fusimotor contraction of the spindle. Simulation results reveal that the equilibrium joint angle is linearly correlated to the level of static gamma fusimotor activity of the spindle for a wide range of external loading conditions and reflex gains, suggesting that these spinal reflexes may contribute to regulate the equilibrium position of the joint. Sensitivity analysis further shows that reflex gains and other central commands alter the quasi-linear relation in regular fashions. The reciprocal inhibition gain changes the slope of the linear theta(eq) - gamma curve; and the descending alpha excitation, the stretch reflex gain, and the external load all shift the theta(eq) - gamma curve in parallel. These results imply that reflex gains and descending alpha commands may be coordinated to maintain a unique theta(eq) - gamma curve while providing the flexibility to counteract external loads, to execute a movement, or to regulate additional muscle variables. Dynamic simulation suggests that control of a class of movements can be achieved with a triphasic, a pulse and a continuous gamma signal., The model study supports the notion of a dual strategy for controlling trajectories via a feedforward a command and for regulating the final equilibrium positions via a feedback gamma command.},

Dendritic amplification is subject to neuromodulatory control from the brainstem by axons releasing the monoamines serotonin and norepinephrine; however, the monoaminergic projection to the cord is diffusely organized and does not allow independent adjustment of amplification in different motor pools. Using in vivo voltage-clamp techniques, here we show that dendritic PICs in ankle extensor motoneurons in the cat are reduced about 50{\{}{\%}{\}} by small rotations (+/- 10 degrees) of the ankle joint. This reduction is primarily due to reciprocal inhibition, a tightly focused input shared only among strict muscle antagonists.

Twenty-one healthy adults performed steady isometric contractions with the DF and PF muscles both with (VIS) and without (NOVIS) visual feedback of the force. The target forces exerted ranged from 2.5{\%} to 80{\%} MVC. The standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of force was measured from the detrended (drift removed) VIS and NOVIS steadiness trials. Removal of VIS reduced the CV of force by 19{\%} overall. The reduction in fluctuations without VIS was significant across a large range of target forces and was more consistent for the PF than the DF muscles. Thus, visuomotor correction contributes to the variability of force during isometric contractions of the ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors.},

However, for nonlinear or non-Gaussian systems, the estimation of states or parameters is a challenging problem. Furthermore, it is often required to process data online. Therefore, apart from being accurate, the feasible estimation algorithm also needs to be fast. In this paper, we review Bayesian filters that possess the aforementioned properties. Each filter is presented in an easy way to implement algorithmic form. We focus on parametric methods, among which we distinguish three types of filters: filters based on analytical approximations (extended Kalman filter, iterated extended Kalman filter), filters based on statistical approximations (unscented Kalman filter, central difference filter, Gauss--Hermite filter), and filters based on the Gaussian sum approximation (Gaussian sum filter). We discuss each of these filters, and compare them with illustrative examples.},

abstract = {The study presents analytical, simulation, and experimental analyses of amplitude cancellation of motor-unit action potentials (APs) in the interference electromyogram (EMG) and its relation to the size of the spike-triggered average (STA) EMG. The amount of cancellation of motor-unit APs decreases monotonically as a function of the ratio between the root mean square (RMS) of the motor-unit AP and the RMS of the interference EMG signal. The theoretical derivation of this association indicates a method to measure cancellation in individual motor units by STA of the interference and squared EMGs. The theoretical relation was examined in both simulated EMG signals generated by populations of 200 motor units and experimental recordings of 492 and 184 motor-unit APs in the vastus medialis and abductor digiti minimi muscles, respectively. Although the theoretical relation predicted (R-2 = 0.95; P < 0.001) the amount of cancellation in the simulated EMGs, the presence of motor-unit synchronization decreased the strength of the association for small APs. The decrease in size of the STA obtained from the squared EMG relative to that extracted from the interference EMG was predicted by the experimental measure of cancellation (R-2 = 0.65; P < 0.001, for vastus medialis; R-2 = 0.26; P < 0.05, for abductor digiti minimi). The results indicate that cancellation of APs in the interference EMG can be analytically predicted and experimentally measured with STA from the discharge times of the motor units into the surface EMG.},

abstract = {The applicability of static optimization (and, respectively, frequently used objective functions) for prediction of individual muscle forces for dynamic conditions has often been discussed. Some of the problems are whether time-independent objective functions are suitable, and how to incorporate muscle physiology in models. The present paper deals with a twofold task: (1) implementation of hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) based on the properties of the motor units (MUs) twitches, and using multi-objective, time-dependent optimization functions; and (2) comparison of the results of the HGA application with those obtained through static optimization with a criterion "minimum of a weighted sum of the muscle forces raised to the power of n". HGA and its software implementation are presented. The moments of neural stimulation of all MUs are design variables coding the problem in the terms of HGA. The main idea is in using genetic operations to find these moments, so that the sum of MUs twitches satisfies the imposed goals (required joint moments, minimal sum of muscle forces, etc.). Elbow flexion and extension movements with different velocities are considered as proper illustration. It is supposed that they are performed by two extensor muscles and three flexor muscles. The results show that HGA is a suitable means for precise investigation of motor control. Many experimentally observed phenomena (such as antagonistic co-contraction, three-phasic behavior of the muscles during fast movements) can find their explanation by the properties of the MUs twitches. Static optimization is also able to predict three-phasic behavior and could be used as practicable and computationally inexpensive method for total estimation of the muscle forces.},

abstract = {The force-length relationship is one of the most important mechanical characteristics of skeletal muscle in humans and animals. For a physiologically realistic joint range of motion and therefore range of muscle fibre lengths only part of the force-length curve may be used in vivo, i.e. only a section of the force-length curve is expressed. A generalised model of a mono-articular muscle-tendon complex was used to examine the effect of various muscle architecture parameters on the expressed section of the force-length relationship for a 90 degrees joint range of motion. The parameters investigated were: the ratio of tendon resting length to muscle fibre optimum length (L-TR : L-F.OPT) (varied from 0.5 to 11.5), the ratio of muscle fibre optimum length to average moment arm (L-F.OPT : r) (varied from 0.5 to 5), the normalised tendon strain at maximum isometric force (c) (varied from 0 to 0.08), the muscle fibre pennation angle (0) (varied from 0 degrees to 45 degrees) and the joint angle at which the optimum muscle fibre length occurred (phi). The range of values chosen for each parameter was based on values reported in the literature for five human mono-articular muscles with different functional roles. The ratios L-TR : L-F.OPT and L-F.OPT : r were important in determining the amount of variability in the expressed section of the force-length relationship. The modelled muscle operated over only one limb at intermediate values of these two ratios (L-TR : L-F.OPT = 5; L-F.OPT : r = 3), whether this was the ascending or descending limb was determined by the precise values of the other parameters. It was concluded that inter-individual variability in the expressed section of the force-length relationship is possible, particularly for muscles with intermediate values of L-TR : L-F.OPT and L-F.OPT : r such as the brachialis and vastus lateralis. Understanding the potential for inter-individual variability in the expressed section is important when using muscle models to simulate movement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Axonal and neuronal injury and loss are of critical importance for permanent clinical disability in multiple sclerosis patients. Axonal injury occurs already early during the disease and accumulates with disease progression. It is not restricted to focal demyelinated lesions in the white matter, but also affects the normal appearing white matter and the grey matter. Experimental studies show that many different immunological mechanisms may lead to axonal and neuronal injury, including antigen-specific destruction by specific T-cells and auto-antibodies as well as injury induced by products of activated macrophages and microglia. They all appear to be relevant for multiple sclerosis pathogensis in different patients and at different stages of the disease. However, in MS lesions a major mechanism of axonal and neuronal damage appears to be related to the action of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which may induce neuronal injury through impairment of mitochondrial function and subsequent energy failure. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In most manipulations, we use our fingertips to apply time-varying forces to the target object in controlled directions. Here we used microneurography to assess how single tactile afferents encode the direction of fingertip forces at magnitudes, rates, and directions comparable to those arising in everyday manipulations. Using a flat stimulus surface, we applied forces to a standard site on the fingertip while recording impulse activity in 196 tactile afferents with receptive fields distributed over the entire terminal phalanx. Forces were applied in one of five directions: normal force and forces at a 20 degrees angle from the normal in the radial, distal, ulnar, or proximal directions. Nearly all afferents responded, and the responses in most slowly adapting (SA)-I, SA-II, and fast adapting (FA)-I afferents were broadly tuned to a preferred direction of force. Among afferents of each type, the preferred directions were distributed in all angular directions with reference to the stimulation site, but not uniformly. The SA-I population was biased for tangential force components in the distal direction, the SA-II population was biased in the proximal direction, and the FA-I population was biased in the proximal and radial directions. Anisotropic mechanical properties of the fingertip and the spatial relationship between the receptive field center of the afferent and the stimulus site appeared to influence the preferred direction in a manner dependent on afferent type. We conclude that tactile afferents from the whole terminal phalanx potentially contribute to the encoding of direction of fingertip forces similar to those that occur when subjects manipulate objects under natural conditions.},

abstract = {The organization of cytoplasm in excitable cells was a largely ignored factor when mathematical models were developed to understand intracellular calcium and secretory behavior. Here we employed a combination of fluorescent evanescent and transmitted light microscopy to explore the F-actin cytoskeletal organization in the vicinity of secretory sites in cultured bovine chromaffin cells. This technique and confocal fluorescent microscopy show chromaffin granules associated with the borders of cortical cytoskeletal cages forming an intricate tridimensional network. Furthermore, the overexpression of SNAP-25 in these cells also reveals the association of secretory machinery clusters with the borders of these cytoskeletal cages. The importance of these F-actin cage borders is stressed when granules appear to interact and remain associated during exocytosis visualized in acridin orange loaded vesicles. These results will prompt us to propose a model of cytoskeletal cages, where the secretory machinery is associated with its borders. Both the calcium level and the secretory response are enhanced in this geometrical arrangement when compared with a random distribution of the secretory machinery that is not restricted to the borders of the cage.

abstract = {The well-known condition for standing stability in static situations is that the vertical projection of the centre of mass (CoM) should be within the base of support (BoS). On the basis of a simple inverted pendulum model, an extension of this rule is proposed for dynamical situations: the position of (the vertical projection of) the CoM plus its velocity times a factor (square root l/g) should be within the BoS, l being leg length and g the acceleration of gravity. It is proposed to name this vector quantity 'extrapolated centre of mass position' (XcoM). The definition suggests as a measure of stability the 'margin of stability' b, the minimum distance from XcoM to the boundaries of the BoS. An alternative measure is the temporal stability margin tau, the time in which the boundary of the BoS would be reached without intervention. Some experimental data of subjects standing on one or two feet, flatfoot and tiptoe, are presented to give an idea of the usual ranges of these margins of stability. Example data on walking are also presented.},

abstract = {Recent research suggests that traditional biomechanical models of postural stability do not fully characterise the nonlinear properties of postural control. In sports medicine, this limitation is manifest in the postural steadiness assessment approach, which may not be sufficient for detecting the presence of subtle physiological change after injury. The limitation is especially relevant given that return-to-play decisions are being made based on assessment results. This update first reviews the theoretical foundation and limitations of the traditional postural stability paradigm. It then offers, using the clinical example of athletes recovering from cerebral concussion, an alternative theoretical proposition for measuring changes in postural control by applying a nonlinear dynamic measure known as 'approximate entropy'. Approximate entropy shows promise as a valuable means of detecting previously unrecognised, subtle physiological changes after concussion. It is recommended as an important supplemental assessment tool for determining an athlete's readiness to resume competitive activity.},

abstract = {Within the field of motor control, there is no consensus on which kinematic and kinetic aspects of movements are planned or controlled. Perturbing goal-directed movements is a frequently used tool to answer this question. To be able to draw conclusions about motor control from kinematic responses to perturbations, a model of the periphery (i.e., the skeleton, muscle-tendon complexes, and spinal reflex circuitry) is required. The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent such conclusions depend on the level of simplification with which the dynamical properties of the periphery are modeled. For this purpose, we simulated fast goal-directed single-joint movement with four existing types of models. We tested how three types of perturbations affected movement trajectory if motor commands remained unchanged. We found that the four types of models of the periphery showed different robustness to the perturbations, leading to different predictions on how accurate motor commands need to be, i.e., how accurate the knowledge of external conditions needs to be. This means that when interpreting kinematic responses obtained in perturbation experiments the level of error correction attributed to adaptation of motor commands depends on the type of model used to describe the periphery.},

Eight subjects (age, 25 +/- 7 yr) performed three tasks involving isometric contraction of elbow flexors while EMG (surface and intramuscular) records were obtained from biceps brachii. Tasks were 1) maximum voluntary contraction (MVC); 2) constant-force contraction at various submaximal targets; and 3) sustained discharge of pairs of concurrently active motor units for 2-5 min. These tasks were performed before, immediately after, and 24 h after fatiguing eccentric exercise. MVC force declined 46{\{}{\%}{\}} immediately after eccentric exercise and remained depressed (31{\{}{\%}{\}}) 24 h later, which is indicative of muscle damage. For the constant-force task, biceps brachii EMG ( approximately 100{\{}{\%}{\}} greater) and force fluctuations ( approximately 75{\{}{\%}{\}} greater) increased immediately after exercise, and both recovered by approximately 50{\{}{\%}{\}} 24 h later. Motor unit synchronization, quantified by cross-correlation of motor unit pairs during low-force (1-26{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC) contractions, was 30{\{}{\%}{\}} greater immediately after (n = 105 pairs) and 24 h after exercise (n = 92 pairs) compared with before exercise (n = 99 pairs). Similarly, motor unit coherence at low (0-10 Hz) frequencies was 20{\{}{\%}{\}} greater immediately after exercise and 34{\{}{\%}{\}} greater 24 h later. These results indicate that the series of events leading to muscle damage from eccentric exercise alters the correlated behavior of human motor units in biceps brachii muscle for > or =24 h after the exercise.},

In accordance with earlier investigations, the units were separated into 4 groups, mainly on the basis of their adaptation and receptive field properties: RA, PC, SA I and SA II units. The extent of the receptive fields of 255 units were mapped with von Frey hairs. The fields of the RA and SA I units were of similar size with medians of 12.6 sq. mm and 11.0 sq. mm. In contrast, the fields of the SA II and PC units were about 5 and 10 times larger, respectively. A difference in size between fields from different skin regions was found only for the RA fields which were smaller the more distal the skin region. The distributions of the field sizes were positively skewed for all 4 unit types. A model was constructed of the population of RA and SA I fields within the various regions of the hand. The model was based on (i) an estimate of the densities of units reported in a previous study, and (ii) the sizes of the receptive fields. The number and the spatial distribution of the fields which would be stimulated by indentations of simple and defined geometries were deduced from the model. The findings indicate that the RA and SA I units provide the information required for the psychophysical capacity of spatial analysis and discrimination in the glabrous skin of the hand.},

abstract = {System identification is the art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. It can be seen as the interface between the real world of applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions. As such, it is an ubiquitous necessity for successful applications System identification is a very large topic, with different techniques that depend on the character of the models to be estimated: linear, nonlinear, hybrid, nonparametric, etc At the same time, the area can be characterized by a small number of leading principles, e.g. to look for sustainable descriptions by proper decisions in the triangle of model complexity, information contents in the data, and effective validation. The area has many facets and there are many approaches and methods A tutorial or a survey in a few pages is not quite possible Instead, this presentation aims at giving an overview of the "science" side, i.e. basic principles and results and at pointing to open problem areas in the practical, "art", side of how to approach and solve a real problem.

abstract = {It has been suggested that esophageal recordings of the diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi) are influenced by changes in chest wall configuration. Whether the changes are of physiological or artifactual origin is unclear. For example, the distance between the esophageal electrode and the diaphragm is likely to alter with chest wall configuration and may lead to misinterpretations of EMGdi. The aims of this study were 1) to evaluate and quantify the effect of the muscle-to-electrode (ME) distance filter on EMGdi, as obtained with a multiple-array esophageal electrode, 2) to take advantage of the ME distance filter to locate the position of the diaphragm with respect to the electrode, and 3) to evaluate the influence of lung volume and chest wall configuration on EMGdi center frequency (CF) while controlling for the ME distance filter and signal quality. Five subjects performed six static contractions of the diaphragm at each of seven chest wall configurations, as evaluated by the method of K. Konno and J. Mead (J. Appl. Physiol. 22: 407-422, 1967). EMGdi was measured with seven pairs of electrodes mounted on an esophageal catheter. The pair of electrodes whose EMGdi power spectra were the least filtered by the ME distance was assumed to be closest to the diaphragm. The results of the study indicated that 1) EMGdi power spectra were strongly affected by the distance between the diaphragm and the electrodes. CF decreased by similar to 1 Hz/mm displacement away from the electrode pair closest to the diaphragm; and 2) no systematic relationship was found between changes in chest wall configuration and CF, when CF was measured from the electrode pair closest to the diaphragm. We conclude that the EMGdi CF can be reliably measured with a multiple-array esophageal electrode that covers the span of diaphragmatic excursion and by selecting the pair of electrodes that is the closest to the diaphragm.},

abstract = {Why and how one should study a scale-space is prescribed by the universal physical law of scale invariance, expressed by the so-called Pi-theorem. The fact that any image is a physical observable with an inner and outer scale bound, necessarily gives rise to a 'scale-space representation', in which a given image is represented by a one-dimensional family of images representing that image on various levels of inner spatial scale. An early vision system is completely ignorant of the geometry of its input. Its primary task is to establish this geometry at any available scale. The absence of geometrical knowledge poses additional constraints on the construction of a scale-space, notably linearity, spatial shift invariance and isotropy, thereby defining a complete hierarchical family of scaled partial differential operators: the Gaussian kernel (the lowest order, rescaling operator) and its linear partial derivatives. They enable local image analysis through the detection of local differential structure in a robust way, while at the same time capturing global features through the extra scale degree of freedom. In this paper we show why the operations of scaling and differentiation cannot be separated. This framework permits us to construct in a systematic way multiscale, cartesian differential invariants, i.e. true image descriptors that exhibit manifest invariance with respect to a change of cartesian coordinates. The scale-space operators closely resemble the receptive field profiles found in mammalian front-end visual systems.},

abstract = {The influence of common oscillatory inputs to the motoneuron pool on correlated patterns of motor unit discharge was examined using model simulations. Motor unit synchronization, in-phase fluctuations in mean firing rates known as 'common drive', and the coefficient of variation of the muscle force were examined as the frequency and amplitude of common oscillatory inputs to the motoneuron pool were varied. The amount of synchronization, the peak correlation between mean firing rates and the coefficient of variation of the force varied with both the frequency and amplitude of the common input signal. Values for 'common drive' and the force coefficient of variation were highest for oscillatory inputs at frequencies less than 5 Hz, while synchronization reached a maximum when the frequency of the common input was close to the average motor unit firing rate. The frequency of the common input signal for which the highest levels of synchronization were observed increased as motoneuron firing rates increased in response to higher target force levels. The simulation results suggest that common low-frequency oscillations in motor unit firing rates and short-term synchronization result from oscillatory activity in different bands of the frequency spectrum of shared motoneuron inputs. The results also indicate that the amount of synchronization between motor unit discharges depends not only on the amplitude of the shared input signal, but also on its frequency in relation to the present firing rates of the individual motor units.},

abstract = {1. The electrical activity of up to eight concurrently active motor units has been recorded from the human deltoid and first dorsal interosseous muscles. The resulting composite myoelectric signals have been decomposed into their constituent motor-unit action potential trains using a recently developed technique.2. A computer cross-correlation analysis has been performed on motor-unit firing rate and muscle-force output records obtained from both constant-force and triangular force-varying isometric contractions performed by normal subjects, and three groups of highly trained performers (long-distance swimmers, powerlifters and pianists).3. The temporal relationships between firing rate activity and force output have provided evidence that the deltoid of long-distance swimmers has a significantly higher percentage of slowly fatiguing fibres than that of normal subjects.4. Results showed that both muscles are incapable of producing a purely isotonic contraction under isometric conditions. Small, possibly compensatory force variations at 1-2 Hz result from a common drive to all active motoneurones in a single muscle pool.5. Rapid force reversals during triangular, force-varying isometric contractions appear to be accomplished through a size-related motor-unit control scheme. All firing rates decline prior to the force peak, but small motor units with slow-twitch responses tend to decrease their firing rates before large, fast-twitch motor units. This mechanism is not visually controlled, and does not depend on force rate in non-ballistic contractions.},

abstract = {Boe SG, Rice CL, Doherty TJ. Estimating contraction level using root mean square amplitude in control subjects and patients with neuromuscular disorders. Objectives: To assess the utility of the surface electromyographic signal as a means of estimating the level of muscle force during quantitative electromyography studies by examining the relationship between muscle force and the amplitude of the surface electromyographic activity signal; and to determine the impact of a reduction in the number of motor units on this relationship, through inclusion of a sample of patients with neuromuscular disease. Design: Cross-sectional, cohort study design. Setting: Tertiary care, ambulatory, electromyography laboratory. Participants: A volunteer, convenience sample of healthy control subjects (n=10), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n=9), and patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X (n=5). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and biceps brachii muscles were examined. Force values (at 10{\{}{\%}{\}} increments) were calculated from two 4-second maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Surface electromyographic activity was recorded during separate 4-second voluntary contractions at 9 force increments (10{\{}{\%}{\}} -90{\{}{\%}{\}} of MVC). Additionally, a motor unit number estimate was derived for each subject to quantify the degree of motor unit loss in patients relative to control subjects. Results: The relationships between force and surface electromyographic activity for both muscles (controls and patients) were best fit by a linear function. The variability about the grouped regression lines was quantified by 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence intervals and found to be ??6.7{\{}{\%}{\}} (controls) and ??8.5{\{}{\%}{\}} (patients) for the FDI and ??5{\{}{\%}{\}} (controls) and ??6.1{\{}{\%}{\}} (patients) for the biceps brachii. Conclusions: These results suggest that the amplitude of the surface electromyographic activity signal may be used as a means of estimating the level of muscle force during quantitative electromyography studies. Future studies should be directed at examining if the variability associated with these force and surface electromyographic activity relationships is acceptable in replacing previous methods of measuring muscle force. ?? 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Persistent inward currents (PICs) are present in many types of neurons and likely have diverse functions. In spinal motoneurons, PICs are especially strong, primarily located in dendritic regions, and subject to particularly strong neuromodulation by the monoamines serotonin and norepinephrine. Because motoneurons drive muscle fibers, it has been possible to study the functional role of their PICs in motor output and to identify PIC-mediated effects on motoneuron firing patterns in human subjects. The PIC markedly amplifies synaptic input, up to fivefold or more, depending on the level of monoaminergic input. PICs also tend to greatly prolong input time course, allowing brief inputs to initiate long-lasting self-sustained firing (i.e., bistable behavior). PIC deactivation usually requires inhibitory input and PIC amplitude can increase to repeated activation. All of these behaviors markedly increase motoneuron excitability. Thus, in the absence of monoaminergic input, motoneuron excitability is very low. Yet PICs have another effect: once active, they tend to sharply limit efficacy of additional synaptic input. All of these PIC effects have been detected in motoneuron firing patterns in human subjects and, hence, PICs are likely a fundamental component of normal motor output.},

Such self-sustained firing behavior has previously been reported in human motor units. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of self-sustained firing behavior in older adults. Eight young (mean age 24 yrs) and eight older (mean age 73 yrs) individuals participated in the investigation. While subjects produced light dorsiflexion contractions, a brief vibration stimulus was applied to the tibialis anterior muscle. Motor unit recordings were also obtained from the tibialis anterior muscle. Self-sustained firing behavior was evidenced by the appearance of new motor unit recruitment following vibration, even as the motor units that fired before the vibratory stimulus maintained a steady firing rate. The proportion of motor units exhibiting self-sustained firing activity was similar in both young and older adults (approx. 23{\%} of trials). We conclude that self-sustained firing behavior is a ubiquitous phenomenon that does not seem to be affected by the aging process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Recently, it has been shown that the input from individual low-threshold mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin of the hand can modulate ongoing activity in muscles acting on the fingers via spinally mediated pathways. We have extended this work to examine whether such strong synaptic coupling exists between tactile afferents in the sole of the foot and motoneurons supplying muscles that act about the ankle. We recorded from 53 low-threshold mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin of the foot via microelectrodes inserted percutaneously into the tibial nerve of awake human subjects. Reflex modulation of ongoing whole muscle electromyography (EMG) was observed for each of the four classes of low-threshold cutaneous mechanoreceptors (17 of 21 rapidly adapting type I; 2 of 4 rapidly adapting type II; 7 of 18 slowly adapting type I; and 4 of 10 slowly adapting type II). Reflex modulation of the firing probability in single motor units (5 of 11) was also observed. These results indicate that strong synaptic coupling between tactile afferents and spinal motoneurons is not a specialization of the hand and emphasizes the potential importance of cutaneous inputs from the sole of the foot in the control of gait and posture.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients suffer from impaired muscle activation and lower limb strength. Strength training enhances muscle activation and muscle strength, but neural adaptations to strength training remain unexplored in MS patients. The hypothesis was that maximal strength training (MST) using high loads and few repetitions would improve central neural drive and thus strength capacity of MS patients. 14 MS patients staying at a national MS rehabilitation center were randomly assigned to a MST group or a control group (CG). Both groups received "today's treatment". In addition, the MST group trained 4 x 4 repetitions of unilateral dynamic leg press and plantar flexion 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Neural adaptations of the soleus muscle were assessed by surface electromyography (EMG) activity, and by superimposed H-reflexes and V-waves obtained during maximum voluntary isometric plantar flexor contractions (MVCs). H-reflexes and V-waves were normalized by the M-wave (H(SUP)/M(SUP), V/M(SUP), respectively). In the MST group, MVC increased by 20 +/- 9{\{}{\%}{\}} (P < 0.05). Soleus EMG activity and V/M(SUP) ratio increased by 40 and 55{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively, in the MST group compared to the CG (P <or= 0.05). The H(SUP)/M(SUP) ratio remained unchanged. No change was apparent in the CG. MST group subjects were able to complete all training sessions. No adverse effects were reported. This randomized study provides evidence that MST is effective of augmenting the magnitude of efferent motor output of spinal motor neurons in MS patients, alleviating some neuromuscular symptoms linked to the disease.},

abstract = {Movements are universally, sometimes frustratingly, variable. When such variability causes error, we typically assume that something went wrong during the movement. The same assumption is made by recent and influential models of motor control. These posit that the principal limit on repeatable performance is neuromuscular noise that corrupts movement as it occurs. An alternative hypothesis is that movement variability arises before movements begin, during motor preparation. We examined this possibility directly by recording the preparatory activity of single cortical neurons during a highly practiced reach task. Small variations in preparatory neural activity were predictive of small variations in the upcoming reach. Effect magnitudes were such that at least half of the observed movement variability likely had its source during motor preparation. Thus, even for a highly practiced task, the ability to repeatedly plan the same movement limits our ability to repeatedly execute the same movement.},

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Rapidly-adapting (RA) mechanoreceptive fibers, which are associated with Meissner corpuscles, mediate one component of the neural information that contributes to the sense of touch. Responses of cat RA fibers subject to 40-Hz sinusoidal stimulation were modeled as a Markov process. Since an RA fiber generates one, two or no spikes in each cycle of the stimulus, the fiber's activity was considered to exist in one of these three possible states. By analyzing empirically generated spike trains, the probability of each state and the probabilities of transitions between the three states were found as a function of the average firing rate of the fiber. The average firing rate depends on the stimulus amplitude. In addition, the phase of each spike with respect to the stimulus cycle was represented by a Laplace distribution. Based on empirical data, the mean and the standard deviation of this distribution decrease as the stimulus amplitude is increased. The entire stochastic model was implemented on a computer to simulate the responses of RA fibers. The post-stimulus time, inter-spike interval and period histograms generated from the simulations match the histograms obtained from the empirical data well as quantified by relative errors. This temporal model can be combined with a population model for average rate to derive a spatio-temporal description of the responses of somatosensory afferents. The effects of changing the stimulation frequency are discussed.},

abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

With respect to non-invasive techniques, intramuscular electromyography has high selectivity for individual motor unit action potentials and is thus used to measure motor unit activity. Decomposition of intramuscular signals into individual motor unit action potentials consists in detection and classification, usually followed by separation of superimposed action potentials. Although intramuscular EMG signal decomposition is the primary tool for physiological investigations of motor unit properties, it is rarely applied in clinical routine, because of the need for human interaction and the difficulty in interpreting the quantitative data provided by EMG signal decomposition to support clinical decisions. The current clinical use of intramuscular EMG signals relates to the diagnosis of myopathies, of diseases of the alpha-motor neuron and of the neuromuscular junction through the analysis of the interference signal or of the shape of some motor unit action potentials, usually without a full decomposition of the signal.},

abstract = {The extensive dendritic tree of the adult spinal motoneuron generates a powerful persistent inward current (PIC). We investigated how this dendritic PIC influenced conversion of synaptic input to rhythmic firing. A linearly increasing, predominantly excitatory synaptic input was generated in triceps ankle extensor motoneurons by slow stretch (duration: 2-10 s) of the Achilles tendon in the decerebrate cat preparation. The firing pattern evoked by stretch was measured by injecting a steady current to depolarize the cell to threshold for firing. The effective synaptic current (I-N, the net synaptic current reaching the soma of the cell) evoked by stretch was measured during voltage clamp. Hyperpolarized holding potentials were used to minimize the activation of the dendritic PIC and thus estimate stretch-evoked I-N for a passive dendritic tree (I-N,I- PASS). Depolarized holding potentials that approximated the average membrane potential during rhythmic firing allowed strong activation of the dendritic PIC and thus resulted in marked enhancement of the total stretch-evoked I-N (I-N,I- TOT). The net effect of the dendritic PIC on the generation of rhythmic firing was assessed by plotting stretch-evoked firing (strong PIC activation) versus stretch-evoked I-N,I- PASS (minimal PIC activation). The gain of this input-output function for the neuron (I-O-N) was found to be similar to2.7 times as high as for the standard injected frequency current (F-I) function in low-input conductance neurons. However, about halfway through the stretch, firing rate tended to become constant, resulting in a sharp saturation in I-O-N that was not present in F-I. In addition, the gain of I-O-N decreased sharply with increasing input conductance, resulting in much lower stretch-evoked firing rates in high-input conductance cells. All three of these phenomena (high initial gain, saturation, and differences in low- and high-input conductance cells) were also readily apparent in the differences between stretch-evoked I-N,I- TOT and I-N,I- PASS and thus could be accounted for by the activation of the dendritic PIC. As a result, stretch-evoked I-N,I- TOT and F-I provided an accurate prediction of the overall change in stretch-evoked firing. However, in about half of the low- input conductance cells, the rate of rise of firing in response to stretch was not smoothly graded but instead consisted of a rapid surge. Stretch-evoked I-N,I- TOT was always smoothly graded. This suggests that although stretch-evoked I-N,I- TOT can be used to predict the overall change in firing, prediction of the dynamics of firing may be less accurate.},

abstract = {To handle the rich repertoire of behavioural goals, the CNS has to control the many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal system in a flexible manner. This problem can be drastically simplified if muscle synergies serve as the to-be-controlled building blocks of motor performance, instead of the individual degrees of freedom. Muscle synergies have been identified as coherent activation patterns of a group of muscles in space or time, but the neural mechanisms underlying their formation remain largely unknown. Here we evaluated the hypothesis that synergies are reflected in common input to different contributing muscles, and investigated modulations in motor unit (MU) synchronization of homologous muscles during a rhythmic balance task. If common input is related to muscle synergies, the resultant MU synchronization should not be static but task dependent and, in the present context, vary in time. Coherence between surface electromyographic signals of bilateral leg muscles revealed MU synchronization in two distinct frequency bands. MU synchronization was not constant but modulated within a movement cycle, and its time course resembled the activation patterns of the muscles. These results are congruent with a linkage between MU synchronization and muscle synergies, and suggest that MU synchronization provides an expedient method for studying synergy-related neural mechanisms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Motor recovery after stroke is attributed to neuronal plasticity, however not all post-stroke neuronal changes relate to regaining fine motor control. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) is a measure allowing to trace neuronal reorganizations which are functionally relevant for motor recovery. Contrary to previous studies which were performed only in chronic stage, we measured CMC in patients with stroke at both acute and chronic stroke stages.

METHODS: For the detection of CMC we used multichannel EEG and EMG recordings along with an optimization algorithm for the detection of corticomuscular interactions.

RESULTS: In acute stroke, the CMC amplitude was larger on the unaffected side compared to the affected side and also larger compared to the unaffected side in the chronic period. Additionally, CMC peak frequencies on both sides decreased in the acute compared to the chronic period and to control subjects. In chronic stage, there were no inter-hemispheric or group differences in CMC amplitude or frequency.

CONCLUSIONS: The changes in CMC parameters in acute stroke could result from a temporary decrease in inhibition, which normalizes in the course of recovery. As all patients showed very good motor recovery, the modulation of CMC amplitude and frequency over time might thus reflect the process of motor recovery.

SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate for the first time the dynamical changes of corticomuscular interaction both at acute and chronic stage of stroke.},

abstract = {Recurrent inhibition in the mammalian spinal cord is complex, and its functions are not yet well understood. Skeletomotoneurons (alpha-MNs) excite, via recurrent axon collaterals, inhibitory Renshaw cells (RCs), which in turn inhibit alpha-MNs and other neurons. The anatomical and functional structure of the recurrent inhibitory network is nonhomogeneous, and the gain and filtering characteristics of RCs are modulated by inputs circumventing alpha-MNs. This complex organization is likely to play important roles for the discharge and recruitment properties of alpha-MNs. Modeling this system is a way of investigating hypothesized roles for normal functioning including muscle fatigue and different forms of physiological pathological tremor. In this paper, a detailed model including alpha-MNs, RCs, and the muscle fibers innervated by the alpha-MNs is presented. Outlines of the experimental data underlying the model and the modeling philosophy and procedure are presented. Then the behavior of a RC model is compared with experimental data reported in the literature. Model and experimental data agree well for burst responses elicited by synchronous single-pulse activation of different numbers of motor axons. In addition, the static relation between motor-axon activation rate and RC firing rate agree fairly well in model and experiment, and the same applies to the dynamic responses to step changes in motor-axon rate. The ultimate objective is to use this model in probing the role of recurrent inhibition in the control and stability of (isometric) muscular force under normal and altered conditions occurring during fatigue and muscle pain.},

abstract = {Cortical oscillations have been the target of many recent investigations, because it has been proposed that they could function to solve the "binding" problem. In the motor cortex, oscillatory activity has been reported at a variety of frequencies between approximately 4 and approximately 60 Hz. Previous research has shown that 15-30 Hz oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex is coherent or phase locked to activity in contralateral hand and forearm muscles during isometric contractions. However, the function of this oscillatory activity remains unclear. Is it simply an epiphenomenon or is it related to specific motor parameters? In this study, we investigated task-dependent modulation in coherence between motor cortex and hand muscles during precision grip tasks. Twelve right-handed subjects used index finger and thumb to grip two levers that were under robotic control. Each lever was fitted with a sensitive force gauge. Subjects received visual feedback of lever force levels and were instructed to keep them within target boxes throughout each trial. Surface EMGs were recorded from four hand and forearm muscles, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded using a 306 channel neuromagnetometer. All subjects showed significant levels of coherence (0.086-0.599) between MEG and muscle in the 15-30 Hz range. Coherence was significantly smaller when the task was performed under an isometric condition (levers fixed) compared with a compliant condition in which subjects moved the levers against a spring-like load. Furthermore, there was a positive, significant relationship between the level of coherence and the degree of lever compliance. These results argue in favor of coherence between cortex and muscle being related to specific parameters of hand motor function.},

abstract = {Corticomuscular coherence between the primary motor cortex (M1) and hand muscle electromyograms (EMG) occurs at similar to 20 Hz but is rarely seen at similar to 10 Hz. This is unexpected, because M1 has oscillations at both frequencies, which are effectively transmitted to the spinal cord via the corticospinal tract. We have previously speculated that a specific "neural filter" may selectively reduce coherence at similar to 10 Hz. This would have functional utility in minimizing physiological tremor, which often has a dominant component around this frequency. Recurrent inhibition via Renshaw cells in the spinal cord is a putative neural substrate for such a filter. Here we investigate this system in more detail with a biophysically based computational model. Renshaw cell recurrent inhibition reducedEMGoscillations at similar to 10 Hz, and also reduced corticomuscular coherence at this frequency (from 0.038 to 0.014). Renshaw cell inhibitory feedback also generated synchronous oscillations in the motoneuron pool at similar to 30 Hz. We show that the effects at 10 Hz and 30 Hz can both be understood from the dynamics of the inhibitory feedback loop. We conclude that recurrent inhibition certainly plays an important role in reducing 10 Hz oscillations in muscle, thereby decreasing tremor amplitude. However, our quantitative results suggest it is unlikely to be the only system for tremor reduction, and probably acts in concert with other neural circuits which remain to be elucidated.},

@article{Sutherland2009,
abstract = {The joint influence of recurrent feedback and noise on gain control in a network of globally coupled spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons is studied theoretically and numerically. The context of our work is the origin of divisive versus subtractive gain control, as mixtures of these effects are seen in a variety of experimental systems. We focus on changes in the slope of the mean firing frequency-versus-input bias (f -I) curve when the gain control signal to the cells comes from the cells' output spikes. Feedback spikes are modeled as alpha functions that produce an additive current in the current balance equation. For generality, they occur after a fixed minimum delay. We show that purely divisive gain control, i.e. changes in the slope of the f -I curve, arises naturally with this additive negative or positive feedback, due to a linearizing actions of feedback. Negative feedback alone lowers the gain, accounting in particular for gain changes in weakly electric fish upon pharmacological opening of the feedback loop as reported by Bastian (J Neurosci 6:553-562, 1986). When negative feedback is sufficiently strong it further causes oscillatory firing patterns which produce irregularities in the f -I curve. Small positive feedback alone increases the gain, but larger amounts cause abrupt jumps to higher firing frequencies. On the other hand, noise alone in open loop linearizes the f -I curve around threshold, and produces mixtures of divisive and subtractive gain control. With both noise and feedback, the combined gain control schemes produce a primarily divisive gain control shift, indicating the robustness of feedback gain control in stochastic networks. Similar results are found when the "input" parameter is the contrast of a time-varying signal rather than the bias current. Theoretical results are derived relating the slope of the f -I curve to feedback gain and noise strength. Good agreement with simulation results are found for inhibitory and excitatory feedback. Finally, divisive feedback is also found for conductance-based feedback (shunting or excitatory) with and without noise.},

@article{Aniss1992,
abstract = {1. Reflex responses were elicited in muscles that act at the ankle by electrical stimulation of low-threshold afferents from the foot in human subjects who were reclining supine. During steady voluntary contractions, stimulus trains (5 pulses at 300 Hz) were delivered at two intensities to the sural nerve (1.2-4.0 times sensory threshold) or to the posterior tibial nerve (1.1-3.0 times motor threshold for the intrinsic muscles of the foot). Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made from tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles by the use of intramuscular wire electrodes. 2. As assessed by averages of rectified EMG, stimulation of the sural or posterior tibial nerves at nonpainful levels evoked a complex oscillation with onset latencies as early as 40 ms and lasting up to 200 ms in each muscle. The most common initial responses in TA were a decrease in EMG activity at an onset latency of 54 ms for sural stimuli, and an increase at an onset latency of 49 ms for posterior tibial stimuli. The responses of PL to stimulation of the two nerves began with a strong facilitation at 44 ms (sural) and 49 ms (posterior tibial). With SOL, stimulation of both nerves produced early inhibition beginning at 45 and 50 ms, respectively. With both LG and MG, sural stimuli produced an early facilitation at 52-53 ms. However, posterior tibial stimuli produced different initial responses in these two muscles: facilitation in LG at 50 ms and inhibition in MG at 51 ms. 3. Peristimulus time histograms of the discharge of 61 single motor units revealed generally similar reflex responses as in multiunit EMG. However, different reflex components were not equally apparent in the responses of different single motor units: an individual motor unit could respond slightly differently with a change in stimulus intensity or background contraction level. The multiunit EMG record represents a global average that does not necessarily depict the precise pattern of all motor units contributing to the average. 4. When subjects stood erect without support and with eyes closed, reflex patterns were seen only in active muscles, and the patterns were similar to those in the reclining posture. 5. It is concluded that afferents from mechanoreceptors in the sole of the foot have multisynaptic reflex connections with the motoneuron pools innervating the muscles that act at the ankle. When the muscles are active in standing or walking, cutaneous feedback may play a role in modulating motoneuron output and thereby contribute to stabilization of stance and gait.},

abstract = {The number of consecutive strides that can be recorded in measurements of gait have been limited due to the number of force plates and dimensions of the measurement field. In addition, the feet are constrained to land on the force plates. A method to calculate the inverse dynamics from the motion and incomplete information from the ground reaction forces (GRF), vertical component and its application point, is presented and compared to the calculations based on force plate measurements. This method is based on the estimation of the three-dimensional GRF during walking with pressure insoles. RMS errors were lower than 20 W for knee joint power compared to those derived from force plate measurements. The errors were larger during double stance phase due to errors in the application point measured with the insoles. This method, with some technical improvement, could be implemented in new gait analysis protocols measuring several consecutive steps either on a treadmill or over ground, depending on the motion-measurement system, without constraining foot placement.},

Needle electrode examination usually reveals early recruitment of short duration motor unit potentials, often with fibrillation potentials. In CIP, the findings are usually those of a generalized axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy.

abstract = {In the decerebrate cat during static or slowly varying (less than 0.3 Hz) muscle stretches, the activity of muscle spindle (MS) pairs was poorly correlated and such correlation was not changed after ventral root sectioning. With slightly faster sinusoidal stretches (0.3-20 Hz) activity in pairs of MS was also poorly correlated. However, sectioning of the ventral roots produced preferential firing frequencies in the same muscle spindle pairs and increased their degree of correlation. The increase in correlation between MS activity detected after suppressing the gamma bias appeared to arise from extrinsic 60 Hz power line vibration in the range of micrometers. Nevertheless, activation of the gamma system could suppress such phase locking. When frequencies above 20 Hz were used, the gamma system could not decorrelate the MS pair activity since the two units became locked to their common input signal. It is suggested that decorrelation of MS activity by gamma influence may improve the fidelity of the information transmitted by the Ia MS ensemble by filtering distortion harmonics, as well as damping tremor oscillations in the stretch reflex loop.},

abstract = {Muscles convert metabolic energy into mechanical work. A computational model of muscle would ideally compute both effects efficiently for the entire range of muscle activation and kinematic conditions (force and length). We have extended the original Virtual Muscle algorithm (Cheng , 2000) to predict energy consumption for both slow- and fast-twitch muscle fiber types, partitioned according to the activation process (E(a)), cross-bridge cycling (E(xb)) and ATP/PCr recovery (E(recovery)). Because the terms of these functions correspond to identifiable physiological processes, their coefficients can be estimated directly from the types of experiments that are usually performed and extrapolated to dynamic conditions of natural motor behaviors. We also implemented a new approach to lumped modeling of the gradually recruited and frequency modulated motor units comprising each fiber type, which greatly reduced computational time. The emergent behavior of the model has significant implications for studies of optimal motor control and development of rehabilitation strategies because its trends were quite different from traditional estimates of energy (e.g., activation, force, stress, work, etc.). The model system was scaled to represent three different human experimental paradigms in which muscle heat was measured during voluntary exercise; predicted and observed energy rate agreed well both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

abstract = {The importance of the interaction between the body and the brain for the control of behavior has been recognized in recent years with the advent of neuromechanics, a field in which the coupling between neural and biomechanical processes is an explicit focus. A major tool used in neuromechanics is simulation, which connects computational models of neural circuits to models of an animal's body situated in a virtual physical world. This connection closes the feedback loop that links the brain, the body, and the world through sensory stimuli, muscle contractions, and body movement. Neuromechanical simulations enable investigators to explore the dynamical relationships between the brain, the body, and the world in ways that are difficult or impossible through experiment alone. Studies in a variety of animals have permitted the analysis of extremely complex and dynamic neuromechanical systems, they have demonstrated that the nervous system functions synergistically with the mechanical properties of the body, they have examined hypotheses that are difficult to test experimentally, and they have explored the role of sensory feedback in controlling complex mechanical systems with many degrees of freedom. Each of these studies confronts a common set of questions: (i) how to abstract key features of the body, the world and the CNS in a useful model, (ii) how to ground model parameters in experimental reality, (iii) how to optimize the model and identify points of sensitivity and insensitivity, and (iv) how to share neuromechanical models for examination, testing, and extension by others.},

@article{Mezzarane2011a,
abstract = {Recent experiments have identified neuromechanical interactions between the arms and legs during human locomotor movement. Previous work reported that during the rhythmic movement of all four limbs, the influence of the arms on reflex expression in the legs was superimposed on the dominant effect of the legs. This evidence was based upon studies using cutaneous and H-reflex modulation as indices of neuronal activity related to locomotion. The earlier H-reflex study was restricted to one phase of movement and to only a fixed H-reflex amplitude. Also, all four limbs were actively engaged in locomotor movement, and this led to the speculation that the effect from the arms could be underestimated by "swamping" of the conditioning during movement of the test limb. Work from the cat suggests that descending locomotor drive may be differentially specified for different motor unit populations in the hindlimb. Accordingly, details of interlimb coordination between the arms and legs in humans require further characterization and an examination of different populations of motor units as can be obtained from H-reflex recruitment curve (RC) parameters. Using modulation of H-reflex amplitudes across the entire ascending limb as neural probes for interlimb coupling, the present study evaluated the separated influences of rhythmic activity of the arms and leg on neuronal excitability of a stationary "test leg". This three-limb "reduced" locomotion approach was applied using a stepping ergometer during the performance of three rhythmic movement tasks: arms (A); contralateral leg (L); and arms and contralateral leg (AL). Data were sampled at four different phases of the stepping cycle (using the moving leg as reference): start power (SP); end power (EP); start recovery (SR); and end recovery (ER). The main result was a large and significant influence of rhythmic AL activity on RC parameters of the H-reflex at EP and SP phases. However, the parameters (and thus motor unit populations) were differentially affected at each phase and task. For instance, a significant contribution of arms movement was noticed for H (max) (largest motor units) at EP phase (P < 0.05), but no changes was observed for other parameters related to lower reflex amplitude (e.g., H-reflex evoked with an input that elicited 50{\%} of maximum reflex response during static condition; H@50{\%}). On the other hand, at SR phase, the parameter H@50{\%} was significantly affected during AL compared to L. It is suggested that the remote effect from arms rhythmic activity has been differentially manifested across motor unit populations for each phase of movement. These findings provide definitive evidence for interlimb coupling between cervical and lumbar oscillators in gating the excitability of reflex pathways to a leg muscle for different populations of motorneurons within the pool. This further supports the contention of similar functional organization for locomotor networks in the human when compared to other animals. Additionally, these data provide additional confirmation of the significant role of the output of neural control for rhythmic arm movement in modulating reflex excitability of the legs that is specifically adjusted according to the phase and task.},

abstract = {There has been extensive debate as to whether muscle synergies in motor tasks reflect underlying neural organization or simply correlations in muscle activity that are imposed by the task. One possible means of distinguishing these two alternatives is through the analysis of variability in the electromyogram (EMG). Here, we simulated EMG in eight lower-limb muscles and introduced hypothetical neural coupling between specific muscle groups. Neural coupling was simulated by introducing correlations in the neural activation commands to different muscles (positive, negative, or zero coupling). When the entire EMG signal was used for analysis, the extracted synergies reflected only simultaneous muscle activity, regardless of the neural coupling between the muscles. On the other hand, examining the variability in the EMG after subtracting the ensemble average was successful in identifying the simulated neural coupling. The extracted synergies from these two methods were also different when we analyzed data from participants during treadmill walking. The results emphasize the importance of examining EMG variability to understand the neural basis of muscle synergies.},

abstract = {Repeated stimulation of motor units (MUs) causes an increase of the force output that cannot be explained by linear summation of equal twitches evoked by the same stimulation pattern. To explain this phenomenon, an algorithm for reconstructing the individual twitches, that summate into an unfused tetanus is described in the paper. The algorithm is based on an analytical function for the twitch course modeling. The input parameters of this twitch model are lead time, contraction and half-relaxation times and maximal force. The measured individual twitches and unfused tetani at 10, 20, 30 and 40 Hz stimulation frequency of three rat motor units (slow, fast resistant to fatigue and fast fatigable) are processed. It is concluded that: (1) the analytical function describes precisely the course of individual twitches; (2) the summation of equal twitches does not follow the results from the experimentally measured unfused tetani, the differences depend on the type of the MU and are bigger for higher values of stimulation frequency and fusion index (3) the reconstruction of individual twitches from experimental tetanic records can be successful if the tetanus is feebly fused (fusion index up to 0.7); (4) both the maximal forces and time parameters of individual twitches subtracted from unfused tetani change and influence the course of each tetanus. A discrepancy with respect to the relaxation phase was observed between experimental results and model prediction for tetani with fusion index exceeding 0.7. This phase was predicted longer than the experimental one for better fused tetani. Therefore, a, separate series of physiological experiments and then, more complex model are necessary for explanation of this distinction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effectiveness and frequency dependence of central drive transmission via the alpha-motoneuron pool to the muscle. METHODS: We describe a model for the simulation of alpha-motoneuron firing and the EMG signal as response to central drive input. The transfer in the frequency domain is investigated. Coherence between stochastical central input and EMG is also evaluated. RESULTS: The transmission of central rhythmicities to the EMG signal relates to the spectral content of the latter. Coherence between central input to the alpha-motoneuron pool and the EMG signal is significant whereby the coupling strength hardly depends on the frequency in a range from 1 to 100 Hz. Common central input to pairs of alpha-motoneurons strongly increases the coherence levels. The often-used rectification of the EMG signal introduces a clear frequency dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Oscillatory phenomena are strongly transmitted via the alpha-motoneuron pool. The motoneuron firing frequencies do play a role in the transmission gain, but do not influence the coherence levels. Rectification of the EMG signal enhances the transmission gain, but lowers coherence and introduces a strong frequency dependency. We think that it should be avoided. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show that rhythmicities are translated into alpha-motoneuron activity without strong non-linearities.},

abstract = {1. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of motor unit remodelling in the deficit that develops in the maximum isometric tetanic force (F-o) of whole medial gastrocnemius (MGN) muscles in old compared with adult rats. The F-o values and morphological data were determined for MGN muscles and eighty-two single motor units in muscles of adult (10-12 months) and sixty-two units in those of old (24-26 months) F344 rats. During an unfused tetanus, fast and slow (S) motor units were identified by the presence and absence of sag, respectively. Fast-fatigable (FF) and fast-fatigue-resistant (FR) units were classified by fatigue indices less than or greater than 0 . 50, respectively. 2. For old rats, whole MGN muscle F-o was 29{\%} less than the value of 11 . 2 N measured for adult rats. The deficit in whole muscle F-o of old rats resulted from equivalent decreases in the number of motor units, 16{\%} smaller than the adult value of ninety-seven, and in the mean motor unit F-o value, 14{\%} less than the adult value of 117 mN. 3. With ageing, little motor unit remodelling occurred in FR units, whereas the S and FF motor units demonstrated dramatic, but opposing, changes. For S units, the number of units remained constant, but the number of fibres per motor unit increased 3-fold from 57 to 165. In contrast, the number of FF units decreased by 34{\%} and the number of fibres per motor unit of the remaining units decreased to 86{\%} of the adult value of 333. The age-related remodelling of motor units appeared to involve denervation of fast muscle fibres with reinnervation of denervated fibres by axonal sprouting from slow fibres.},

Evidence that axonal and neuronal pathology contributes to the disease is accumulating, however, the distribution of neuronal injury as well as the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully clarified. Here, we investigated the role of neuronal cell loss in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: We performed electrophysiological investigations in MS patients, including assessment of compound muscle action potentials and motor unit numbers and quantified neuronal cell loss in human MS samples and different EAE models by high-precision stereology. RESULTS: Both electrophysiological and morphological analyses indicated a massive loss of lower motor neurons in MS patients. We regularly found dying spinal motor neurons surrounded by CD3+ (CD4+ as well as CD8+) T cells expressing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). We observed a similar degree of damage and immune attack in different variants of EAE; the lower motor neurons were preserved in adoptive transfer EAE induced with TRAIL-deficient T lymphocytes. INTERPRETATION: Our study indicates that damage to lower motor neurons and TRAIL-mediated inflammatory neurodegeneration in the spinal cord contribute to MS pathology.},

abstract = {The causes of change in resting tension with hypotonic swelling of isolated living frog skeletal muscle fibers were studied by observing their cross-sectional shape. The cross-sectional area steadily increased, in an almost osmometer-like manner, to one-third the standard tonicity. When the cross-sectional shape became almost circular and the circumferential length began to extend, the resting tension began to decrease/increase prominently at sarcomere lengths shorter/longer than 2.8 microns. The coincidence of the occurrence of prominent changes in tension and in the cross-sectional shape indicates that tension changes are closely related to the circumferential extension of the sarcolemma. For reference purposes, we studied the effects of reduction in ionic strength and in osmotic compressive force on the resting tension of mechanically and chemically skinned fibers. We concluded that (1) the decrease in resting tension with hypotonic swelling was mediated by an elevation in intracellular hydrostatic pressure due to the circumferential extension of sarcolemma, and that (2) the increase in tension was due to longitudinal contraction of the two-dimensionally tense sarcolemma, arising from its circumferential extension.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations play an important role in solving complex engineering problems and have the potential to revolutionize medical decision making and treatment strategies. In this paper, we combine the rapid model-based design, control systems and powerful numerical method strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with the simulation and human movement dynamics strengths of OpenSim by developing a new interface between the two software tools. OpenSim is integrated with Simulink using the MATLAB S-function mechanism, and the interface is demonstrated using both open-loop and closed-loop control systems. While the open-loop system uses MATLAB/Simulink to separately reproduce the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool, the closed-loop system adds the unique feature of feedback control to OpenSim, which is necessary for most human movement simulations. An arm model example was successfully used in both open-loop and closed-loop cases. For the open-loop case, the simulation reproduced results from the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool with root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.03 degrees for the shoulder elevation angle and 0.06 degrees for the elbow flexion angle. MATLAB's variable step-size integrator reduced the time required to generate the forward dynamic simulation from 7.1s (OpenSim) to 2.9s (MATLAB). For the closed-loop case, a proportional-integral-derivative controller was used to successfully balance a pole on model's hand despite random force disturbances on the pole. The new interface presented here not only integrates the OpenSim and MATLAB/Simulink software tools, but also will allow neuroscientists, physiologists, biomechanists, and physical therapists to adapt and generate new solutions as treatments for musculoskeletal conditions.},

abstract = {In the present work, a generic model for the prediction of moment-angle characteristics in individual human skeletal muscles is presented. The model's prediction is based on the equation M = V x L-o(-1) sigma x cos phi x d, where M, V and L-o are the moment-generating potential of the muscle, the muscle volume and the optimal muscle fibre length, respectively, and a, 0 and dare the stress-generating potential of the muscle fibres, their pennation angle and the tendon moment arm length, respectively, at any given joint angle. The input parameters V, L-o, sigma, phi and d can be measured or derived mechanistically. This eliminates the common problem of the necessity to estimate one or more of the input parameters in the model by fitting its outcome to experimental results often inappropriate for the function modelled. The model's output was validated by comparisons with the moment-angle characteristics of the gastrocnemius (GS) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in six men, determined experimentally using voluntary contractions at several combinations of ankle and knee joint angles for the GS muscle and electrical stimulation for the TA muscle. Although the model predicted realistically the pattern of moment-angle relationship in both muscles, it consistently overestimated the GS muscle M and consistently underestimated the TA muscle M, with the difference gradually increasing from dorsiflexion to plantarflexion in both cases. The average difference between predicted and measured M was 14{\{}{\%}{\}} for the GS muscle and 10{\{}{\%}{\}} for the TA muscle. Approximating the muscle fibres as a single sarcomere in both muscles and failing to achieve complete TA muscle activation by electrical stimulation may largely explain the differences between theory and experiment.

@article{Fuglevand2006,
abstract = {Spinal motor neurones can exhibit sustained depolarization in the absence of maintained synaptic or injected current. This phenomenon, referred to as a plateau potential, is due to the activation of monoamine-dependent persistent inward currents. Accordingly, activation of a plateau potential should result in a decrease in the excitatory synaptic drive required to activate a motor unit. This, in turn, has been suggested to cause a progressive decline in the muscle force at which motor units are recruited during repeated voluntary contractions. Such a progressive decrease in threshold force associated with preceding activation of a plateau potential is referred to as 'warm up'. Furthermore, activation of a plateau potential is thought to manifest itself as a decrease in the derecruitment force compared to recruitment force. Multiple muscles, however, can contribute to the detected force and their relative contributions may vary over time, which could confound measures of recruitment and derecruitment force. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the recruitment and derecruitment forces of single motor units in the human extensor digitorum and tibialis anterior during repetitive triangular-force contractions in which the contributions of other muscles had been minimized. In both muscles, we found that the recruitment thresholds of single motor units were unchanged during repeated contractions, and that the derecruitment force was consistently greater than the recruitment force. These results suggest either that plateau potentials were not engaged (or were rapidly extinguished) under these experimental conditions or that changes in recruitment and derecruitment force are not suitable criteria for detecting them.},

abstract = {Progress in myoelectric control technology has over the years been incremental, due in part to the alternating focus of the R{\&}D between control methodology and device hardware. The technology has over the past 50 years or so moved from single muscle control of a single prosthesis function to muscle group activity control of multifunction prostheses. Central to these changes have been developments in the means of extracting information from the myoelectric signal. This paper gives an overview of the myoelectric signal processing challenge, a brief look at the challenge from an historical perspective, the state-of-the-art in myoelectric signal processing for prosthesis control, and an indication of where this field is heading. The paper demonstrates that considerable progress has been made in providing clients with useful and reliable myoelectric communication channels, and that exciting work and developments are on the horizon.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability of a scientist to maintain a continuous stream of publication may be important, because research requires continuity of effort. However, there is no data on what proportion of scientists manages to publish each and every year over long periods of time.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the entire Scopus database, we estimated that there are 15,153,100 publishing scientists (distinct author identifiers) in the period 1996-2011. However, only 150,608 (<1{\{}{\%}{\}}) of them have published something in each and every year in this 16-year period (uninterrupted, continuous presence [UCP] in the literature). This small core of scientists with UCP are far more cited than others, and they account for 41.7{\{}{\%}{\}} of all papers in the same period and 87.1{\{}{\%}{\}} of all papers with >1000 citations in the same period. Skipping even a single year substantially affected the average citation impact. We also studied the birth and death dynamics of membership in this influential UCP core, by imputing and estimating UCP-births and UCP-deaths. We estimated that 16,877 scientists would qualify for UCP-birth in 1997 (no publication in 1996, UCP in 1997-2012) and 9,673 scientists had their UCP-death in 2010. The relative representation of authors with UCP was enriched in Medical Research, in the academic sector and in Europe/North America, while the relative representation of authors without UCP was enriched in the Social Sciences and Humanities, in industry, and in other continents.

CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of the scientific workforce that maintains a continuous uninterrupted stream of publications each and every year over many years is very limited, but it accounts for the lion's share of researchers with high citation impact. This finding may have implications for the structure, stability and vulnerability of the scientific workforce.},

abstract = {The determination of conduction velocity in the muscle fibers of single motor units from noninvasive recordings of single motor unit action potentials can be improved by the method of spatially filtering multielectrode EMG. The use of this conduction velocity as a diagnostic tool requires a high reliability of the detected values. However, experiments did reveal that the measured conduction velocity values showed remarkably high fluctuations depending on the recording site along the muscle fibers which could not be attributed to the influence of the endplate and tendon region. The present work examines the hypothesis that the observed fluctuations in propagation velocity were caused by electrically inhomogeneous tissue, regions of different electrical conductivity which are located between the excited muscle fibers and the recording electrodes and which cause a deformation of the extracellular electric current field. The investigation was performed by means of a physical model as well as by finite element model calculations. In both models single, simple shaped (cylindrical) inhomogeneity regions with a conductivity of 0.1 to 10 times that of the surrounding medium and diameters ranging between 1.6 and 2.7 mm were placed between excitation sources and recording site. The results indicate that the observed conduction velocity fluctuations of up to some 10{\%} can be well attributed to inhomogeneity effects of the tissue conductivity. Based on these results, one may look for signal processing methods to cut down such fluctuations in conduction velocity measurements.},

@article{Abbott2005,
abstract = {In 1998, Sherman and Guillery proposed that there are two types Of inputs to cortical neurons; drivers and modulators. These two forms of input are required to explain how, for example, sensory driven responses are controlled and modified by attention and other internally generated gating signals. One might imagine that driver signals are carried by fast ionotropic receptors, whereas modulators correspond to slower inetabotropic receptors. Instead, we have proposed a novel mechanism by which both driver and modulator inputs could be carried by transmission through the same types of ionotropic receptors. In this scheme, the distinction between driver and modulator inputs is functional and changeable rather than anatomical and fixed. Driver inputs are carried by excitation and inhibition acting in a push-pull manner. This means that increases in excitation are accompanied by decreases in inhibition and vice versa. Modulators correspond to excitation and inhibition that covary so that they increase or decrease together. Theoretical and experimental work has shown that such an arrangement modulates the gain of a neuron, rather than driving it to respond. Constructing drivers and modulators in this manner allows individual excitatory synaptic inputs to play either role, and indeed to switch between roles, depending on how they are linked with inhibition.},

abstract = {Single motor-unit firing rates have been recorded during maximal voluntary contractions using tungsten microelectrodes. Over 300 units from four subjects were sampled from each of three muscles. These were the biceps brachii, adductor pollicis, and soleus, chosen because of known differences in their fiber-type composition and contractile properties. In all cases the contraction maximality was assured by delivering single supramaximal shocks during the voluntary contractions. All motor units were deemed to have already been fully activated if no additional force resulted. Thus for each muscle, the firing rates elicited by a maximal voluntary effort are sufficient to generate a fully fused tetanus in each motor unit. For the biceps brachii and adductor pollicis muscles, the mean firing rates (+/- SD) were 31.1 +/- 10.1 and 29.9 +/- 8.6 Hz, respectively, while for soleus they were only 10.7 +/- 2.9 HZ. For each muscle the firing rates distribution covered approximately a four-fold range about the mean value. The mean firing rates for each muscle varied roughly in proportion to their respective twitch contraction and half relaxation times. These contractile time measurements for both biceps brachii and adductor pollicis agreed well with the mean values reported for human fast-twitch motor units, while those for soleus fell in the range observed for human slow-twitch units. An argument is presented that suggests that, in response to voluntary effort, the range of discharge rates of each motor-unit pool is limited to those only just sufficient to produce maximum force in each motor unit. This suggestion is based on the relationship between the range of motor-unit firing frequencies observed during maximum voluntary contractions, their range of contraction times, and the stimulation frequencies required for maximum force generation. The implications of this hypothesis for motor control are discussed.},

@article{Hof2003,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the properties of the mechanical system, especially muscle elasticity and limb mass, to a large degree determine force output and movement. This makes the control demands of the central nervous system simpler and more robust. In human triceps surae, a muscle with short fibres and a long tendon, the time courses of the total muscle+tendon length and of the length of the contractile component (CC) alone in running are completely different. The muscle tendon complex shows first an eccentric phase with negative work, followed by a concentric phase. The CC, on the other hand, is concentric all the time. Moreover, the work that is done, is done at a speed that guarantees a high energetic efficiency. It is argued that this high efficiency is an in-built property of the muscle mechanics for muscles with a compliant tendon and a low nu(max). When a muscle, or a set of muscles, moves a mass, and the duration of the action is short with respect to the isometric time constant of the muscle, we may call it an 'elastic bounce contraction'. In such a case the mass-spring interaction largely determines the time course of the force, and the efficiency of muscle contraction is most of the time close to optimum. In a similar way, whole limbs can be modelled as springs, with a stiffness that can be modulated by flexing the joints more or less. The motor control task of the central nervous system is simple for such elastic bounce contractions: a block-like activation is sufficient, in which timing is critical, but activation level is not. It seems possible that a whole class of actions can be generated by an identical timing sequence, with only a modulation in activation amplitude. An example is walking or running at different speeds.

abstract = {This study demonstrates the impact of the bipolar electrode transfer function on the canine diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) power spectrum, as evaluated with a new electrode design and implantation technique, The results show that: (a) changes in interelectrode distance transformed single-peaked power spectrums into double-peaked spectrums; (b) the mean action potential conduction velocity (<(APCV)over bar>), and power spectrum center frequency (CF) and median frequency (MF), are related for interelectrode distances of 5 and 10 mm, but not for 15 and 20 mm; and (c) CF, MF, - 3-dB, and - 6-dB bandwidth values depend on interelectrode distance. We conclude that bipolar electrodes, with a nonfixed interelectrode distance, cannot be used for physiological interpretations of the EMG power spectrum. Nonetheless, power spectrums obtained with fixed and appropriate interelectrode distances can be trusted, if the electrodes are positioned in the direction of the muscle fibers and in regions with low densities of motor endplates.

abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is commonly used in rehabilitation, but electrically-evoked muscle activation is in several ways different from voluntary muscle contractions. These differences lead to challenges in the use of NMES for restoring muscle function. We investigated the use of low-current, high-frequency nerve stimulation to activate the muscle via the spinal motor neuron (MN) pool in order to achieve more natural activation patterns. Using a novel stimulation protocol, the H-reflex responses to individual stimuli in a train of stimulation pulses at 100 Hz were reliably estimated with surface EMG during low-level contractions. Furthermore, single motor unit recruitment by afferent stimulation was analyzed with intramuscular EMG. The results showed that substantially elevated H-reflex responses were obtained during 100-Hz stimulation with respect to a lower stimulation frequency. Furthermore, motor unit recruitment using 100-Hz stimulation was not fully synchronized, as it occurs in classic NMES, and the discharge rates differed among motor units because each unit was activated only after a specific number of stimuli. The most likely mechanism behind these observations is the temporal summation of sub-threshold excitatory post synaptic potentials from Ia fibers to the MNs. These findings and their interpretation were also verified by a realistic simulation model of afferent stimulation of a MN population. These results suggest that the proposed stimulation strategy may allow generation of considerable levels of muscle activation by motor unit recruitment that resembles the physiological conditions.},

An important challenge for understanding motor function is to connect these three levels of the motor system - motor behaviour, limb mechanics and neural control. Optimal feedback control theory might provide the important link across these levels of the motor system and help to unravel how the primary motor cortex and other regions of the brain plan and control movement.},

abstract = {The pattern of electromyographic activity of the equine long back muscle at the walk has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to use surface electromyography to measure activity of the longissimus dorsi muscles of horses walking on a treadmill. Fifteen horses without back pain were used and electromyographs were recorded bilaterally from the longissimus dorsi muscles at the level of T12, T16 and L3. Mean electromyograph activity and mean motion were calculated for each horse. At the walk, only one maximum activity for each longissimus dorsi muscle was detected during each motion cycle and this was highest at T12 and lowest at L3. Activity of the longissimus dorsi muscles at the walk is mainly responsible for stabilisation of the vertebral column against dynamic forces. At T12 the high maximum activity could contribute to the development of muscle pain at this site. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Is human balance control dominated by time invariant continuous feedback mechanisms or do noncontinuous mechanisms play a significant role like intermittent control? The goal of this paper is to quantify how much of the postural responses evoked by pseudorandom external periodic perturbations can be explained by continuous time invariant feedback control. Nine healthy subjects participated in this study. Center of mass and ankle torque responses were elicited by periodic platform perturbations in forward-backward directions containing energy in the 0.06- to 4.5-Hz frequency band. Subjects had their eyes open (EO) or eyes closed (EC). Responses were decomposed into a periodic component and a remnant (stochastic) component using spectral analysis. It is concluded that periodic responses can explain most of the evoked responses, although the remnant power spectral densities (PSDs) were significant especially for slow responses (<0.2 Hz) and largest for EC. The found remnant PSD did depend on the sensory condition but not on the platform perturbation amplitude. The ratio of the body sway and ankle torque remnant PSD reflects the body dynamics. Both findings are consistent with the idea that estimation of body orientation is part of a continuous feedback loop and that (stochastic) estimation errors increase when one source of sensory information is removed. The findings are not consistent with the idea that discrete or discontinuous intermittent feedback mechanisms significantly shape postural responses.},

The aim of this study was to determine how frequent peak activity occurred during an MVIC for soleus (SOL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) in select KF positions, and if these peaks were recorded in similar KF positions. Forty-eight healthy individuals performed unilateral plantar-flexion MVIC in standing with 0°KF and 45°KF, and in sitting with 90°KF. Surface EMG of SOL, GM, and GL were collected and processed in 250 ms epochs to determine peak root-mean-square amplitude. Peak activity was most frequently captured in standing and rarely in sitting, with no position selective to SOL, GM or GL activity. Peak GM and GL activity was more frequent in 0°KF than 45°KF, and more often in similar KF positions than not. Peak SOL activity was just as likely in 45°KF as 0°KF, and more in positions similar to GM, but not GL. The EMG amplitudes were at least 20{\{}{\%}{\}} greater in positions that captured peak activity over those that did not. The overall findings support performing an MVIC in more than one KF position to normalize triceps surae EMG. It is emphasized that no KF position is selective to SOL, GM, or GL alone.},

abstract = {Voluntary muscle fatigue is a progressive process. A recent study demonstrated muscle fatigue-induced weakening of functional corticomuscular coupling measured by coherence between the brain [electroencephalogram (EEG)] and muscle [electromyogram (EMG)] signals after a relatively long-duration muscle contraction. Comparing the EEG-EMG coherence before versus after fatigue or between data of two long-duration time blocks is not adequate to reveal the dynamic nature of the fatigue process. The purpose of this study was to address this issue by quantifying single-trial EEG-EMG coherence and EEG, EMG power based on wavelet transform. Eight healthy subjects performed 200 maximal intermittent handgrip contractions in a single session with handgrip force, EEG and EMG signals acquired simultaneously. The EEG and EMG data during each 2-s handgrip was subjected to single trial EEG-EMG wavelet energy spectrum and coherence computation. The EEG-EMG coherence and energy spectrum at beta (15 {\{}{\~{}}{\}} 35 Hz) and gamma (35-50 Hz) frequency bands were statistically analyzed in 2-block (75 trials per block), 5-block (30 trials/block), and 10-block (15 trials/block) data settings. The energy of both the EEG and EMG signals decreased significantly with muscle fatigue. The EEG-EMG coherence had a significant reduction for the 2-block comparison. More detailed dynamical changing and inter-subject variation of the EEG-EMG coherence and energy were revealed by 5- and 10-block comparisons. These results show feasibility of wavelet transform-based measurement of the EEG-EMG coherence and corresponding energy based on single-trial data, which provides extra information to demonstrate a time course of dynamic adaptations of the functional corticomuscular coupling, as well as brain and muscle signals during muscle fatigue.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to determine the relative contribution of the gastrocnemius muscle to isometric plantar flexor torque production at varying knee angles, while investigating the activation of the gastrocnemius muscle at standardised non-optimal lengths. Voluntary plantar flexor torque, supramaximally stimulated twitch torque and myoelectric activity (EMG) from the triceps surae were measured at different knee angles. Surface and intra-muscular EMG were recorded from the soleus muscle and the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle in 10 male subjects. With the ankle angle held constant, knee angle was changed in steps of 30 degrees ranging from 180 degrees (extended) to 60 degrees (extreme flexion), while voluntary torque from a 5-s contraction was determined at 10 different levels of voluntary effort, ranging from 10{\%} of maximal effort to maximal effort. To assess effort, supramaximal twitches were superimposed on all voluntary contractions, and additionally during rest. Maximal plantar flexor torque and resting twitch torque decreased significantly in a sigmoidal fashion with increasing knee flexion to 60{\%} of the maximum torque at 180 degrees knee angle. For similar levels of voluntary effort, the EMG root mean square (RMS) of gastrocnemius was less with increased knee flexion, whereas soleus RMS remained unchanged. From these data, it is concluded that the contribution of gastrocnemius to plantar flexor torque is at least 40{\%} of the total torque in the straight leg position. The decrease of gastrocnemius EMG RMS with decreasing muscle length may be brought about by a decrease in the number of fibres within the EMG electrode recording volume and/or impaired neuromuscular transmission.},

Changes in the mechanical parameters of this musculo-articular structure were quantified with the aid of a sinusoidal perturbation technique. This technique allowed the expression of the mechanical impedance of the musculo-articular system in terms of stiffness, viscosity and inertia. Measurements were performed under passive conditions and when the subject performed plantar flexion. A 7-week period of training induced a decrease in the slope of the relationship between stiffness and plantar flexion torque, whereas passive stiffness was increased. A slight decrease in viscosity and an invariability in inertia were also found. These results are interpreted in terms of the possible adaptations of the musculo-articular structure and ultrastructure involved in the performance of plantar flexion.},

A proposed function of these oscillations is to control the flow of signals among anatomically connected networks. However, the nature of neural coding that may support selective communication that depends on oscillations has received relatively little attention. Here, we consider the role of multiplexing, whereby multiple information streams share a common neural substrate. We suggest that multiplexing implemented through periodic modulation of firing-rate population codes enables flexible reconfiguration of effective connectivity among brain areas.},

abstract = {Oscillatory activity in the beta (beta)-frequency band (13-35 Hz) can be recorded over the sensorimotor cortex in humans. It is coherent with electromyographic activity (EMG) during tonic contraction, but whether the cortical beta-oscillations are primarily motor or sensorimotor in function remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that cortical beta-activity is associated with an up-regulation of sensory inputs that may be relevant to the organization of the motor response. We recorded cortical somatosensory potentials (SEPs) elicited by electrical stimuli to the median nerve at the wrist triggered by increases of electroencephalographic (EEG) beta-activity in the contralateral fronto-central EEG and compared these to SEPs presented at random intervals. The involvement of motor cortex in the triggering EEG activity was confirmed by a simultaneous elevation of cortico-spinal synchrony in the beta-band. The negative cortical evoked potential peaking at 20 ms and the positive evoked potential peaking at 30 ms after median nerve shocks were increased in size when elicited after phasic increases in beta-activity. The functional coupling of sensory and motor cortices in the beta-band was confirmed in recordings of electrocorticographic activity in two patients with chronic pain syndromes, suggesting a means by which beta-activity may simultaneously influence cortical sensory processing, motor output and promote sensory-motor interaction.},

abstract = {Upper-limb movements are often composed of regular submovements, and neural correlates of submovement frequencies between 1 and 4 Hz have been found in the motor cortex. The temporal profile of movements is usually assumed to be determined by extrinsic factors such as limb biomechanics and feedback delays, but another possibility is that an intrinsic rhythmicity contributes to low frequencies in behavior. We used multielectrode recordings in monkeys performing an isometric movement task to reveal cyclic activity in primary motor cortex locked to submovements, and a distinct oscillation in premotor cortex. During ketamine sedation and natural sleep, cortical activity traversed similar cycles and became synchronized across areas. Because the same cortical dynamics are coupled to submovements and also observed in the absence of behavior, we conclude that the motor networks controlling the upper limb exhibit an intrinsic periodicity at submovement frequencies that is reflected in the speed profile of movements. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The background of the bioelectric activity of muscle recorded from the surface of the skin (surface electromyography) in terms of the representation of single motor units of the underlying muscle(s) is not very well documented or understood. An insight into the composition of an electromyogram is essential for the proper interpretation of one of the most widely applied electrophysiological techniques. In the present paper, a study of the contribution of single motor unit potentials to;the surface electromyogram is presented. To this end, the decline of different components of the motor unit potential with depth of the motor unit is quantified. Experimentally, the action potentials from motor units at several positions in the muscle were recorded by 30 skin surface electrodes. Simultaneous use of scanning electromyography provided information about the actual position and size of the motor unit. Observed linear log-log relationships between motor unit potential magnitudes and distance indicated the usefulness of a power function to describe the motor unit potential's dependence on recording distance. It is shown that different specific surface motor unit potential characteristics fall off differently with depth. The magnitude-distance relationship is shown to be dependent on the recording configuration (unipolar vs. bipolar recording, including the inter-electrode distance) and the chosen motor unit potential parameter (negative peak amplitude, positive peak amplitude and area).},

These cells are located in lamina VII of the spinal cord, are excited by motor axon collaterals, and inhibit homonymous and synergistic motoneurons in a negative-feedback fashion (recurrent inhibition). Early dysfunction and/or loss of Renshaw cells has been suggested to occur in experimental ALS, and the hypothesis has been put forward that this may be the event that makes motoneurons more susceptible to glutamatergic toxicity in ALS. However, Renshaw cell properties and connectivity-in particular, the lack of recurrent inhibition in the more distal muscles of the limbs where, on the contrary, initial wasting is prominent in human ALS-make it unlikely that impairment of Renshaw cells is a general feature of the human form of the disease.},

A method of MUP presentation is suggested. It provides accuracy of the MUPs calculated for any distance and size of rectangular electrodes together with considerably reduced computational load and time. No simplification of the IAP shape or location of muscle fibres of different diameters and lengths is required. The MUP generated by N temporally and spatially dispersed single fibre action potentials is considered to be the output signal of a linear timeshift invariant system for potential generation. The input signal is the first temporal derivative of the IAP. The common impulse response (CIR) is the sum of potentials produced at the electrode by N pairs of dipoles propagating from the motor end-plates to the ends of the corresponding fibres. The potentials of each dipole at the rectangular plate electrode are determined analytically. Thus, the MUP is calculated as a single convolution between the input signal and CLR for a rectangular electrode of any size. (C) 1998 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rudolph2006,
abstract = {Event-driven simulation strategies were proposed recently to simulate integrate-and-fire (IF) type neuronal models. These strategies can lead to computationally efficient algorithms for simulating large-scale networks of neurons; most important, such approaches are more precise than traditional clock-driven numerical integration approaches because the timing of spikes is treated exactly. The drawback of such event-driven methods is that in order to be efficient, the membrane equations must be solvable analytically, or at least provide simple analytic approximations for the state variables describing the system. This requirement prevents, in general, the use of conductance-based synaptic interactions within the framework of event-driven simulations and, thus, the investigation of network paradigms where synaptic conductances are important. We propose here a number of extensions of the classical leaky IF neuron model involving approximations of the membrane equation with conductance-based synaptic current, which lead to simple analytic expressions for the membrane state, and therefore can be used in the event-driven framework. These conductance-based IF (gIF) models are compared to commonly used models, such as the leaky IF model or biophysical models in which conductances are explicitly integrated. All models are compared with respect to various spiking response properties in the presence of synaptic activity, such as the spontaneous discharge statistics, the temporal precision in resolving synaptic inputs, and gain modulation under in vivo-like synaptic bombardment. Being based on the passive membrane equation with fixed-threshold spike generation, the proposed gIF models are situated in between leaky IF and biophysical models but are much closer to the latter with respect to their dynamic behavior and response characteristics, while still being nearly as computationally efficient as simple IF neuron models. gIF models should therefore provide a useful tool for efficient and precise simulation of large-scale neuronal networks with realistic, conductance-based synaptic interactions.},

abstract = {Shunting inhibition, a conductance increase with a reversal potential close to the resting potential of the cell, has been shown to have a divisive effect on subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes. It has therefore been assumed to have the same divisive effect on firing rates. We show that shunting inhibition actually has a subtractive effect on the firing rate in most circumstances. Averaged over several interspike intervals, the spiking mechanism effectively clamps the somatic membrane potential to a value significantly above the resting potential, so that the current through the shunting conductance is approximately independent of the firing rate. This leads to a subtractive rather than a divisive effect. In addition, at distal synapses, shunting inhibition will also have an approximately subtractive effect if the excitatory conductance is not small compared to the inhibitory conductance. Therefore regulating a cell's passive membrane conductance-for instance, via massive feedback-is not an adequate mechanism for normalizing or scaling its output.},

The initial segment and the soma include models of several types of ionic currents, including a calcium-dependent slow potassium current. The dendritic tree is modeled as a series association of several electrically passive cylinders. Afterhyperpolarization parameters, current to frequency relation and the responses to input current steps, ramps and sinusoids were used for model validation. The effects of sinusoidally varying synaptic inputs at different levels of the dendritic tree were studied by computer simulation. The corresponding frequency response functions resulted of lowpass type with cutoff' frequencies from 10 to 40 Hz, for synapses occurring more distally or more proximally, respectively. The nonlinear effects caused by two sinusoidally varying synaptic conductances (at 7 and 11 Hz), acting at different dendritic segments, were quantified by spectral analysis of the current reaching the soma. The simulations pointed to two main nonlinear effects: (i) harmonics of the two input frequencies (e.g., 14 Hz) and (ii) intermodulation terms (e.g., 4 Hz). When the two synaptic inputs occurred on more distal dendritic compartments the nonlinear effects were more pronounced. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Afferents from the otolith organs and the semicircular canals converge with optokinetic, somatosensory and motor-related signals in the vestibular nuclei, which are reciprocally interconnected with the vestibulocerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. Here, we review the properties of the many cell types in the vestibular nuclei, as well as some fundamental computations implemented within this brainstem-cerebellar circuitry. These include the sensorimotor transformations for reflex generation, the neural computations for inertial motion estimation, the distinction between active and passive head movements, as well as the integration of vestibular and proprioceptive information for body motion estimation. A common theme in the solution to such computational problems is the concept of internal models and their neural implementation. Recent studies have shed new insights into important organizational principles that closely resemble those proposed for other sensorimotor systems, where their neural basis has often been more difficult to identify. As such, the vestibular system provides an excellent model to explore common neural processing strategies relevant both for reflexive and for goal-directed, voluntary movement as well as perception.},

In order to build Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) models, computer models that capture and integrate the complex systemic dynamics of living organisms across radically different space-time scales, we need to re-formulate a vast body of existing biology and physiology knowledge so that it is formulated as a quantitative hypothesis, which can be expressed in mathematical terms. Once the predictive accuracy of these models is confirmed against controlled experiments and against clinical observations, we will have VPH model that can reliably predict certain quantitative changes in health status of a given patient, but also, more important, we will have a theory, in the true meaning this word has in the scientific method. In this scenario, biomechanics plays a very important role, biomechanics is one of the few areas of life sciences where we attempt to build full mechanistic explanations based on quantitative observations, in other words, we investigate living organisms like physical systems. This is in our opinion a Copernican revolution, around which the scope of biomechanics should be re-defined. Thus, we propose a new definition for our research domain "Biomechanics is the study of living organisms as mechanistic systems".},

Th following parameters are then calculated and tested for their diagnostic significance: sway path (SP), mean amplitude of sway (MA), mean sway frequency (MF), their lateral and sagittal components, and the quotients sagittal/lateral of these as well as the sway area (SA) circumscribed by the COF. Quotients of eyes open/eyes closed for all these parameters determine the visual stabilization of posture. Sway position and sway direction histograms allow for a more detailed analysis of MA and SP. Despite considerable inter- and intraindividual variance of these parameters (in 28 normals), some of them seem of clinical significance not only for documentation and follow-up studies but also for differential diagnosis. In patients with cerebellar lesions (n = 12), SP and MA were up to 10 times larger with a marked antero-posterior instability, MF being above normal. Patients with labyrinthine lesions (n = 10) showed significant instability only with eyes closed, MF being slightly below normal.},

abstract = {The role of the cerebral cortex in maintaining human standing balance remains unclear. Beta corticomuscular coherence (CMC) provides a measure of communication between the sensory-motor cortex and the muscle, but past literature has not demonstrated significant beta CMC during human stance. This study evaluated the effects of stance width, vision, and surface compliance on beta CMC during human stance using methods to enhance sensitivity to CMC. Ten healthy, young adults stood for three 60-s trials in each of a wide or narrow stance width while on a firm surface and in narrow stance on a foam surface, each with eyes open or closed. Beta CMC was calculated between contralateral electroencephalographic and electromyographic recordings. Electromyography was recorded from bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis muscles. CMC magnitude was defined as the average integrated area of coherence spectrum above a significance threshold. Measures of center-of-pressure (COP) sway were derived from force plates under the subjects' feet. Results of CMC from 4 muscles across 6 stance conditions (a total of 24 combinations) demonstrated significant average CMC magnitude from every subject in 20 combinations and significant average CMC magnitude in nine of 10 subjects in the remaining four combinations. The CMC magnitude was significantly larger in the wide-stance condition than in the narrow-stance condition with eyes open. No significant differences were detected when comparing eyes-open to eyes-closed conditions or when comparing firm- to foam-surface conditions. Correlations between CMC magnitude and COP sway elicited some significant relationships, but there was no consistent direction or pattern of correlation based on muscle or stance condition. Results demonstrate that significant beta CMC is evident during human standing balance, and that beta CMC is responsive to changes in mechanical, but not visual or surface, conditions.},

abstract = {Frequency analysis may have some advantages over back-averaging in the neurophysiological assessment of patients with suspected cortical myoclonus in whom myoclonic EMG bursts repeat rhythmically at high frequency. However, the clinical utility of EEG-EMG coherence and related EMG-EMG coherence is not established. Equally, there is an incomplete understanding of the physiology of the systems contributing to the coherence evident between signals in cortical myoclonus. Here we address these issues in an investigation of EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG coupling in proximal and distal muscles of the upper extremities in nine patients with multifocal high frequency rhythmic myoclonus due to non-progressive conditions. We found exaggerated coherence between EEG and contralateral EMG and between pairs of ipsilateral EMG signals. The results of frequency analysis of EMG-EMG mirrored those for EEG-EMG, but the former technique was superior in distinguishing a pathologically exaggerated common drive in distal upper limb muscles. Both techniques were more sensitive than back-averaging. Frequency analysis also revealed important disparities between proximal and distal upper limb muscles. In the latter case, the functional coupling between cortex and muscle was dominated by efferent processes. In contrast, there was considerable inter-individual variation in the extent to which EEG-EMG and EMG-EMG coupling in proximal muscles reflected afferent and efferent loops. Thus, the processes sustaining myoclonic discharges may differ for proximal and distal muscles and between patients.},

abstract = {Postural control was studied when the subject was kneeling with erect trunk in a quiet posture and compared to that obtained during quiet standing. The analysis was based on the center of pressure motion in the sagittal plane (CPx), both in the time and in the frequency domains. One could assume that postural control during kneeling would be poorer than in standing because it is a less natural posture. This could cause a higher CPx variability. The power spectral density (PSD) of the CPx obtained from the experimental data in the kneeling position (KN) showed a significant decrease at frequencies below 0.3 Hz compared to upright (UP) (P < 0.01), which indicates less sway in KN. Conversely, there was an increase in fast postural oscillations (above 0.7 Hz) during KN compared to UP (P < 0.05). The root mean square (RMS) of the CPx was higher for UP (P < 0.01) while the mean velocity (MV) was higher during KN (P < 0.05). Lack of vision had a significant effect on the PSD and the parameters estimated from the CPx in both positions. We also sought to verify whether the changes in the PSD of the CPx found between the UP and KN positions were exclusively due to biomechanical factors (e.g., lowered center of gravity), or also reflected changes in the neural processes involved in the control of balance. To reach this goal, besides the experimental approach, a simple feedback model (a PID neural system, with added neural noise and controlling an inverted pendulum) was used to simulate postural sway in both conditions (in KN the pendulum was shortened, the mass and the moment of inertia were decreased). A parameter optimization method was used to fit the CPx power spectrum given by the model to that obtained experimentally. The results indicated that the changed anthropometric parameters in KN would indeed cause a large decrease in the power spectrum at low frequencies. However, the model fitting also showed that there were considerable changes also in the neural subsystem when the subject went from standing to kneeling. There was a lowering of the proportional and derivative gains and an increase in the neural noise power. Additional increases in the neural noise power were found also when the subject closed his eyes.},

abstract = {Motor disability in MS is commonly assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Categorical rating scales are limited by subjective error and inter-rater variability. Therefore, objective and quantitative measures of motor disability may be useful to supplement the EDSS in the setting of clinical trials. It was previously shown that grip-force-variability (GFV) is increased in MS. We hypothesized that GFV may be an objective measure of motor disability in MS. To investigate whether the increase in GFV in MS is correlated to the clinical disability as assessed by the EDSS and to microstructural changes in the brain as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging, GFV was recorded in a grasping and lifting task in 27 MS patients and 23 controls using a grip-device equipped with a force transducer. The EDSS was assessed by neurologists experienced in MS. Patients underwent diffusion tensor imaging at 3T to assess the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cerebral white matter as a measure of microstructural brain integrity. GFV was increased in MS and correlated to changes in the FA of white matter in the vicinity of the somatosensory and visual cortex. GFV also correlated with the EDSS. GFV may be a useful objective measure of motor dysfunction in MS linked to disability and structural changes in the brain. Our data suggests that GFV should be further explored as an objective measure of motor dysfunction in MS. It could supplement the EDSS, e.g., in proof of concept studies.},

Even beyond this period of pronounced plasticity, the NMJ undergoes subtle morphological remodeling-expansion and retraction-although its overall dimensions remain stable. This natural, continual NMJ remodeling is amplified with alterations in neuromuscular activity. Increased activity, presented by exercise training, typically results in expansion of NMJ size. Disuse, brought about by neurotoxins, denervation, or spaceflight, also elicits substantial reconfiguring of the endplate.},

abstract = {In this study we investigated the time course of length and velocity of muscle fascicles and tendinous tissues (TT) during isometric twitch contraction, and examined how their interaction relates to the time course of external torque and muscle fascicle force generation. From seven males, supra-maximal twitch contractions (singlet) of the tibialis anterior muscle were induced at 30 degrees, 10 degrees and -10 degrees plantar flexed positions. The length and velocity of fascicles and TT were determined from a series of their transverse ultrasound images. The maximal external torque appeared when the shortening velocity of fascicles was zero. The fascicle and TT length, and external torque showed a 10-30 ins delay of each onset, with a significant difference in half relaxation times at -10 degrees. The time course of TT elongation, and fascicle and tendinous velocities did not differ between joint angles. Curvilinear length-force properties, whose slope of quasi-linear part was ranged from -15.0 to -5.9N/mm for fascicles and 5.4 to 14.3N/mm for TT, and a loop-like pattern of velocity-force properties, in which the mean power was ranged from 0.14 to 0.80W for fascicles, and 0.14 to 0.81 W for TT were also observed. These results were attributed to the muscle-tendon interaction, depending on the slack and non-linearity of length-force relationship of compliant TT. We conclude that the mechanical interaction between fascicles and TT, are significant determinants of twitch force and time characteristics. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In models of the excitation of muscles it is often assumed that excitation during a tetanic contraction can be obtained by the linear summation of responses to individual stimuli from which the active state of the muscle is calculated The purpose of this study was to investigate whether such a model adequately describes the process of excitation of muscle. Parameters describing the contraction dynamics of the muscle model used were derived from physiological and morphological measurements made on the gastrocnemius medialis muscle of three adult Wistar rats. Parameters pertaining to the excitation dynamics were optimized such that the muscle model correctly predicted force histories recorded during an isometric twitch. When a relationship between intracellular calcium and active state from literature on rat muscle was used, the muscle model was capable of generating force histories at stimulation frequencies of 20, 40, 60 and 80 Hz and other muscle-tendon complex lengths which closely matched those measured experimentally - albeit forces were underestimated slightly in all cases. Differences in responses to higher stimulation frequencies between animals could be traced back to differences in twitch dynamics between the animals and adequate predictions of muscle forces were obtained for all animals. These results suggest that the linear summation of responses to individual stimuli indeed gives an adequate description of the excitation of muscle.},

abstract = {Many spatial filters have been proposed for surface electromyographic (EMG) signal detection. Although theoretical and modeling predictions on spatial selectivity are available, there are no extensive experimental validations of these techniques based on single motor unit (MU) activity detection. The aim of this study was to compare spatial selectivity of one- and two-dimensional (1-D and 2-D) spatial filters for EMG signal detection. Intramuscular and surface EMG signals were recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle of ten subjects. The simultaneous use of intramuscular wire and surface recordings (with the spike triggered averaging technique) allowed investigation of the activity of single MUs at the skin surface. The surface EMG signals were recorded with a grid of point electrodes (3x3 electrodes) and a ring electrode system at 15 locations over the muscle, with the wires detecting signals from the same intramuscular location. For most subjects, it was possible to classify, from the intramuscular recordings, the activity of the same MUs for all the contractions. The surface EMG signals were averaged with the intramuscularly detected MU action potentials as triggers. In this way, eight spatial filters-longitudinal and transversal, single and double differential (LSD, TSD, LDD, TDD), Laplacian (NDD), inverse binomial filter of the second order (1132), inverse rectangle filter (111), and differential ring system (C1)-could be compared on the basis of their spatial selectivity. The distance from the source (transversal with respect to the muscle fiber orientation) after which the surface detected potential did not exceed +/-5{\%} of the maximal peak-to-peak amplitude (detection distance) was statistically smaller for the 2-D systems and TDD than for the other filters. The MU action potential duration was significantly shorter with LDD and with the 2-D systems than with the other filters. The 2-D filters investigated (including C1) showed very similar performance and were, thus, considered equivalent from the point of view of spatial selectivity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Somatosensory function declines with diabetic neuropathy and often with stroke, resulting in diminished motor performance. Recently, it has been shown that input noise can enhance human sensorimotor function. The goal of this study was to investigate whether subsensory mechanical noise applied to the soles of the feet via vibrating insoles can be used to improve quiet-standing balance control in 15 patients with diabetic neuropathy and 15 patients with stroke. Sway data of 12 healthy elderly subjects from a previous study on vibrating insoles were added for comparison. METHODS: Five traditional sway parameters and three sway parameters from random-walk analysis were computed for each trial (no noise or noise). RESULTS: Application of noise resulted in a statistically significant reduction in each of the eight sway parameters in the subjects with diabetic neuropathy, the subjects with stroke, and the elderly subjects. We also found that higher levels of baseline postural sway in sensory-impaired individuals was correlated with greater improvements in balance control with input noise. INTERPRETATION: This work indicates that noise-based devices could ameliorate diabetic and stroke impairments in balance control.},

abstract = {Converging evidence is consistent with the view that fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis is independent from pyramidal tract involvement, suggesting a possible involvement of frontal areas. During voluntary movement, changes of the EEG rhythms can be observed over sensorimotor areas. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the 10 and 20 Hz frequency bands occurs during motor planning and execution and is followed after movement termination by event-related synchronization (ERS), expressing cortical idling or inhibition. We evaluated the pattern of cortical activation to voluntary movement in MS patients complaining of fatigue assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale. Fifteen MS patients complaining of fatigue, 18 MS patients without fatigue, and 14 normal controls were studied. The two patients groups were similar for age, sex, disease duration, and were not disabled (score <1.5 at the Expanded Disability Status Scale). Twenty-nine channel EEG was recorded during about 60 self-paced extensions of the right thumb. The onset latency and amount of the contralateral sensorimotor (C3 electrode) 10 and 18--22 Hz ERD were similar in the three groups. ERD was more widespread anteriorly in the fatigue group compared with normal controls (P < 0.01 over Fz electrode). Postmovement contralateral sensorimotor 18--22 Hz ERS was significantly lower in fatigue MS patients compared with normal subjects (P < 0.005) and with nonfatigue MS patients (P = 0.02). These findings are consistent with a central origin of fatigue in MS and indicate cortical dysfunction even during a simple motor task, resulting in hyperactivity during movement execution and failure of the inhibitory mechanisms intervening after movement termination.},

J Appl Physiol 108: 85-97, 2010. First published November 12, 2009; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00070.2009.-A matrix of 120 electromyogram (EMG) electrodes (8 rows and 15 columns) was used to investigate individual activation patterns of the medial (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles during forward sways of the body in human quiet stance. This matrix was positioned on the right calf of eight subjects after identification of the MG and LG contours with ultrasound scanning. Gray-scale images were generated with the maxima and minima of the cross-correlation function between the envelope of each EMG signal and the body center of pressure (CoP) for individual forward sways. These images were automatically segmented to reduce the data set into representative and local values of EMG-CoP cross-correlation for each muscle. On average, modulations in EMG amplitude preceded the onset of forward sways with a variable timing, with both gastrocnemius muscles being similarly and synchronously modulated in 193 out of 236 sways. Variations in the timing of activation between muscles were less frequent, although consistent across subjects and significantly correlated with changes in the direction and velocity of body sways. Interestingly, the time shift between EMG and CoP traces sometimes varied consistently along different channels of the same column of electrodes, either in proximal-to-distal or distal-to-proximal direction. The variable EMG-CoP cross-correlation delay was not congruent with the delay expected for the propagation of surface potentials along muscle fibers. Comparison of surface EMGs with intramuscular EMGs recorded from six subjects demonstrated that surface potentials provide high spatial selectivity, thus supporting the notion of selective activation of motor units during quiet standing. Hence, the stabilization of the quiet standing posture likely relies on flexible rather than stereotyped mechanisms of control.},

abstract = {It has recently been shown that motor units in human medial gastrocnemius (MG), activated during standing, occupy relatively small territories along the muscle's longitudinal axis. Such organisation provides potential for different motor tasks to produce differing regional patterns of activity. Here, we investigate whether postural control and nerve electrical stimulation produce equal longitudinal activation patterns in MG. Myoelectric activity, at different proximal-distal locations of MG, was recorded using a linear electrode array. To ensure differences in signal amplitude between channels did not result from local, morphological factors two experimental protocols were completed: (i) quiet standing; (ii) electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. Averaged, rectified values (ARVs) were calculated for each channel in each condition. The distribution of signals along electrode channels was described using linear regression and differences between protocols at each channel determined as the ratio between mean ARV from standing: stimulation protocols. Ratio values changed systematically across electrode channels in seven (of eight) participants, with larger values in distal channels. The distribution of ARV along MG therefore differed between experimental conditions. Compared to fibres of units activated during MG nerve stimulation, units activated during standing may have a tendency to be more highly represented in the distal muscle portion.},

The patellofemoral syndrome results from a malalignment of the knee extensor mechanism. The purpose of our study was to describe and compare EMG responses of the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles while walking up and down stairs and other clinical and functional responses in PFS subjects before and after a physical therapy intervention. Eleven subjects were studied and divided in two groups: six subjects with clinically diagnosed patellofemoral syndrome and five healthy control subjects. Subjects were evaluated by a functional and biomechanical evaluation protocol: postural evaluation, pain and knee function evaluation, and electromyographic activity of vastus medialis and lateralis muscles while walking tip and down a staircase. Results showed higher efficiency of the vastus medialis muscle in carrying out eccentric exercises and increased Muscle activity in both the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles while climbing stairs after physical therapy treatment. We were able to identify an improvement in postural alignment of lower limb muscles and knee functionality among patellofemoral syndrome group subjects after treatment. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In humans, this work has been limited to magnetic recordings. In the present study we investigate if similar results can be obtained using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG recordings were made from over the sensorimotor cortex of five adult subjects who performed repeated periods of maintained wrist extension and flexion. Coherence analysis between EEG and electromyogram (EMG) recordings from these muscles revealed correlation in the 15-30 Hz range, with a synchronous correlation structure which matches that previously observed in humans and in paired cortical recordings from primates. We conclude that EEG is equally efficient at investigating functional aspects of these cortical rhythms during voluntary movement in humans.},

Six human subjects performed static and dynamic contractions at an ankle joint angle of 110 degrees plantar flexion and within the range of 90-110 degrees (anatomic position = 90 degrees) under constant load (10{\%} maximal voluntary contraction) for 210 min. Surface electromyogram records from lateral gastrocnemius (LG), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and soleus (Sol) muscles showed high and silent activities alternately in the three muscles and a complementary and alternate activity between muscles in the time course. In the second half of all exercise times, the number of changes in activity increased significantly (P < 0.05) in each muscle. The ratios of active to silent periods of electromyogram activity were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in MG (4.5 +/- 2.2) and Sol (4.3 +/- 2.8) than in the LG (0.4 +/- 0.1), but no significant differences were observed between MG and Sol. These results suggest that the relative activation of synergistic motor pools are not constant during a low-level fatiguing task.},

abstract = {This brief review examines some of the methods used to infer central control strategies from surface electromyogram (EMG) recordings. Among the many uses of the surface EMG in studying the neural control of movement, the review critically evaluates only some of the applications. The focus is on the relations between global features of the surface EMG and the underlying physiological processes. Because direct measurements of motor unit activation are not available and many factors can influence the signal, these relations are frequently misinterpreted. These errors are compounded by the counterintuitive effects that some system parameters can have on the EMG signal. The phenomenon of crosstalk is used as an example of these problems. The review describes the limitations of techniques used to infer the level of muscle activation, the type of motor unit recruited, the upper limit of motor unit recruitment, the average discharge rate, and the degree of synchronization between motor units. Although the global surface EMG is a useful measure of muscle activation and assessment, there are limits to the information that can be extracted from this signal.},

It characterizes the volume conductor as a non-homogeneous and anisotropic medium, and allows simulation of EMG signals generated by finite-length fibers without approximation of the current-density source. The influence of thickness of the subcutaneous tissue layers, fiber inclination, fiber depth, electrode size and shape, spatial filter transfer function, interelectrode distance, length of the fibers on surface, single-fiber action-potential amplitude, frequency content, and estimated conduction velocity are investigated in this paper. Implications of the results on electrode positioning procedures, spatial filter design, and EMG signal interpretation are discussed.},

abstract = {A potential treatment for paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury is to route control signals from the brain around the injury by artificial connections. Such signals could then control electrical stimulation of muscles, thereby restoring volitional movement to paralysed limbs(1-3). In previously separate experiments, activity of motor cortex neurons related to actual or imagined movements has been used to control computer cursors and robotic arms(4-10), and paralysed muscles have been activated by functional electrical stimulation(11-13). Here we show that Macaca nemestrina monkeys can directly control stimulation of muscles using the activity of neurons in the motor cortex, thereby restoring goal-directed movements to a transiently paralysed arm. Moreover, neurons could control functional stimulation equally well regardless of any previous association to movement, a finding that considerably expands the source of control signals for brain- machine interfaces. Monkeys learned to use these artificial connections from cortical cells to muscles to generate bidirectional wrist torques, and controlled multiple neuron - muscle pairs simultaneously. Such direct transforms from cortical activity to muscle stimulation could be implemented by autonomous electronic circuitry, creating a relatively natural neuroprosthesis. These results are the first demonstration that direct artificial connections between cortical cells and muscles can compensate for interrupted physiological pathways and restore volitional control of movement to paralysed limbs.},

The latencies and shapes of these features are, therefore, determined primarily by the motor-unit (MU) architecture and the intracellular action potential (IAP), rather than by the volume-conduction characteristics of the limb. We present a simple model to explain these relationships. The MUAP is modeled as the convolution of a source function related to the IAP and a weighting function related to the MU architecture. The IAP waveform is modeled as the sum of a spike and a slow repolarization phase. The MU architecture is modeled by assuming that the individual fibers lie along a single equivalent axis but that their action potentials have dispersed initiation and termination times. The model is illustrated by simulating experimentally recorded MUAPs and compound muscle action potentials.},

This approach provides a clear set of guidelines for combining experimental data with other knowledge about sensory function to obtain a description that optimally predicts the way that neurons process sensory information. This prediction paradigm provides an objective method for evaluating and comparing computational models. In this chapter we review many of the system identification algorithms that have been used in sensory neurophysiology, and we show how they can be viewed as variants of a single statistical inference problem. We then review many of the practical issues that arise when applying these methods to neurophysiological experiments: stimulus selection, behavioral control, model visualization, and validation. Finally we discuss several problems to which system identification has been applied recently, including one important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience: developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Repeated periods of stimulation of the spinal cord and training increased the ability to control movement in animal models of spinal cord injury. We hypothesised that tonic epidural spinal cord stimulation can modulate spinal circuitry in human beings into a physiological state that enables sensory input from standing and stepping movements to serve as a source of neural control to undertake these tasks. METHODS: A 23-year-old man who had paraplegia from a C7-T1 subluxation as a result of a motor vehicle accident in July 2006, presented with complete loss of clinically detectable voluntary motor function and partial preservation of sensation below the T1 cord segment. After 170 locomotor training sessions over 26 months, a 16-electrode array was surgically placed on the dura (L1-S1 cord segments) in December 2009, to allow for chronic electrical stimulation. Spinal cord stimulation was done during sessions that lasted up to 250 min. We did 29 experiments and tested several stimulation combinations and parameters with the aim of the patient achieving standing and stepping. FINDINGS: Epidural stimulation enabled the man to achieve full weight-bearing standing with assistance provided only for balance for 4.25 min. The patient achieved this standing during stimulation using parameters identified as specific for standing while providing bilateral load-bearing proprioceptive input. We also noted locomotor-like patterns when stimulation parameters were optimised for stepping. Additionally, 7 months after implantation, the patient recovered supraspinal control of some leg movements, but only during epidural stimulation. INTERPRETATION: Task-specific training with epidural stimulation might reactivate previously silent spared neural circuits or promote plasticity. These interventions could be a viable clinical approach for functional recovery after severe paralysis. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health and Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.},

The purpose of the on-going study is to train stroke survivors to overcome common foot drop and balance problems in order to improve their ambulatory performance. Its design follows the same guidelines of our upper extremity designs, i.e., it is a low friction, backdriveable device with intrinsically low mechanical impedance. Here, we report on the design and mechanical characteristics of the robot. We also present data to demonstrate the potential of this device as an efficient clinical measurement tool to estimate intrinsic ankle properties. Given the importance of the ankle during locomotion, an accurate estimate of ankle stiffness would be a valuable asset for locomotor rehabilitation. Our initial ankle stiffness estimates compare favorably with previously published work, indicating that our method may serve as an accurate clinical measurement tool.},

abstract = {Humans can stand using sensory information solely from the ankle muscles. Muscle length and tension in the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) are unlikely to signal postural sways on account of balance-related modulation in agonist activity. These facts pose two questions: (1) Which ankle muscles provide the proprioceptive information? (2) Which peripheral mechanism could modulate agonist activity? To address these issues, subjects were asked to stand normally on two force plates. Ultrasound and surface EMG were recorded from the calf and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. For all nine subjects, changes in muscle length of TA were mainly (84 +/- 9{\{}{\%}{\}} whole trial duration) orthodoxly correlated with bodily sway (centre of gravity, CoG), i.e. in accordance with passive ankle rotation. When orthodox, TA had the highest correlation with CoG (-0.66 +/- 0.07, deep compartment, P < 0.001). For five subjects, the superficial TA compartment showed counter-intuitive changes in muscle length with CoG, probably due to the flattening of the foot and proximal attachment geometry. Gastrocnemius and soleus were usually (duration 71 +/- 23 and 81 +/- 16{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively) active agonists (paradoxically correlated with CoG) but, for short periods of time, they could be orthodox and then presented a moderate correlation (0.38 +/- 0.16 and 0.28 +/- 0.09, respectively) with CoG. Considering the duration and extent to which muscle length is orthodox and correlated with CoG, TA may be a better source of proprioceptive information than the active agonists (soleus and gastrocnemius). Therefore, if a peripheral feedback mechanism modulates agonist activity then reciprocal inhibition acted by TA on the calf muscles is more likely to be effective than the autogenic pathway.},

@article{Xu2001,
abstract = {Neuronal axons are cellular extensions that can reach more than a meter in length. To maintain such a structure, macromolecules synthesized in cell bodies must be transported to the distal axons. Proteins associated with membranous organelles are generally transported in several fast transported groups, while cytoplasmic proteins, mostly composed of cytoskeletal proteins, are transported in slowly transported groups. Neurofilaments are a main component in the slowly transported group. Composed of three polypeptide subunits (NF-H, NF-M and NF-L), they are the most abundant cytoskeletal element in large myelinated axons. In various neurological or neurotoxic disorders, selective accumulation of neurofilaments was observed in different compartments of a neuron (cell bodies, proximal or distal axons). The underlying mechanism for this regional selectivity has been unclear. Using the classical pulse labeling method, we examined the changes in neurofilament transport velocity in transgenic mice that overexpress different neurofilament subunits. We present evidence that at least three velocities of neurofilament transport exist along peripheral motor axons. Each of these velocities was altered differently depending on which neurofilament subunit was overexpressed. We suggest that neurofilament transport in motor axons consists of multiple successive stages and that each of these stages is carried out by different transport mechanisms. These differences provide a basis for the regional deficiencies in axonal transport associated with several neurological disorders. (C) 2001 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{ElBasiouny2006,
abstract = {The goal of this study was to investigate the nature of activation of the dendritic calcium persistent inward current (Ca2+ PIC) and its contribution to the enhancement and summation of synaptic inputs in spinal motoneurones. A compartmental cable model of a cat alpha-motoneurone was developed comprising the realistic dendritic distribution of Ia-afferent synapses and low-voltage-activated L-type calcium (Ca(v)1.3) channels distributed over the dendrites in a manner that was previously shown to match a wide set of experimental measurements. The level of synaptic activation was systematically increased and the resulting firing rate, somatic and dendritic membrane potentials, dendritic Ca(v)1.3 channel conductance, and dendritic Ca2+ PIC were measured. Our simulation results suggest that during cell firing the dendritic Ca2+ PIC is not activated in an all-or-none manner. Instead, it is initially activated in a graded manner with increasing synaptic input until it reaches its full activation level, after which additional increases in synaptic input result in minimal changes in the Ca2+ PIC (PIC saturated). The range of graded activation of Ca2+ PIC occurs when the cell is recruited and causes a steep increase in the firing frequency as the synaptic current is increased, coinciding with the secondary range of the synaptic frequency-current (F-I) relationship. Once the Ca2+ PIC is saturated the slope of the F-I relationship is reduced, corresponding to the tertiary range of firing. When the post-spike after-hyperpolarization (AHP) is blocked, either directly by blocking the calcium-activated potassium channels, or indirectly by blocking the sodium spikes, the PIC is activated in an all-or-none manner with increasing synaptic input. Thus, the AHP serves to limit the depolarization of the cell during firing and enables graded, rather than all-or-none, activation of the Ca2+ PIC. The graded activation of the Ca2+ PIC with increasing synaptic input results in a graded (linear) enhancement and linear summation of synaptic inputs. In contrast, the saturated Ca2+ PIC enhances synaptic inputs by a constant amount (constant current), and leads to less-than linear summation of multiple synaptic inputs. These model predictions improve our understanding of the mode of activation of the dendritic Ca2+ PIC and its role in the enhancement and integration of synaptic inputs.},

The computation of Lyapunov exponents for continuous time dynamical systems is straightforward whenever they are ruled by vector fields that are sufficiently smooth to admit a variational model. Hybrid neurons do not belong to this wide class of systems since they are intrinsically non-smooth owing to the impact and sometimes switching model used to describe the integrate-and-fire (I{\&}F) mechanism. In this paper we show how a variational model can be defined also for this class of neurons by resorting to saltation matrices. This extension allows the computation of Lyapunov exponent spectrum of hybrid neurons and of networks made up of them through a standard numerical approach even in the case of neurons firing synchronously.},

However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.},

abstract = {The alpha-motoneurone afterhyperpolarization (AHP) duration correlates with a number of its muscle unit properties in animal preparations. In humans, the interval death rate (IDR) analysis has been used to estimate the time course of human motoneurone AHP based on the pattern of motor unit firing. The purpose of this experiment was first, to examine the relationship between estimated AHP time course and the minimal firing rate of the motor unit and second, to examine the relationship between the AHP and motor unit contractile properties in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Motor unit data were obtained from the TA muscle during low force isometric contractions lasting 600 s. Muscle unit twitch characteristics were determined using spike-triggered averaging (STA) and the motoneurone AHP time course was estimated using the IDR analysis. Minimal discharge rate and derecruitment threshold torque were determined for 2 s preceding motor unit derecruitment. The AHP time constant and minimal discharge rate were negatively correlated, whereas the derecruitment threshold torque was not associated with the AHP time constant. The estimated AHP duration, however, is considerably shorter than the mean ISI of the minimal discharge rate suggesting that synaptic noise and AHP duration are important factors in dictating the minimal discharge rate in low force voluntary contractions in humans. The AHP time constant did not vary significantly with motor unit twitch amplitude; however, significant positive relationships were found between the AHP time constant and the temporal properties of the motor unit twitch. The calculated AHP time course using the IDR analysis, therefore, is a reasonable estimate and coupled with motor unit properties attained with STA, it provides a powerful method to describe low-threshold motor units.},

abstract = {A model of the surface EMG signal based on a realistic arm anatomy is presented. A finite element volume conductor model was developed using magnetic resonance (MR) images of the upper arm of a healthy male subject. The model includes both resistive and capacitive material properties. To examine the ability of the model to predict the potential distribution around the surface of the arm, experimental and simulated data were compared during the application of a sub-threshold current source to the skin surface. The agreement between the simulated and experimental data varied with the choice of material properties used, with the closest approximation to the experimental data yielding a mean root mean square (RMS) error at the recording electrodes of 18{\%} or 27{\%}, depending on the site of the applied current source. To examine the influence of limb geometry on the EMG signal, action potentials from a curved muscle fiber in the reatistic volume conductor model and an idealized cylindrical model were compared. The specific geometry of the limb caused substantial variations in the shapes of the surface potentials. However, more qualitative features of the surface EMG signal, such as the rate of decay of the surface action potential amplitude, were similar in both the realistic and idealized volume conductor models.},

The EMG signals were simulated experimentally under conditions where the activation of nearly the entire pool of motor units or of subsets of motor units was completely controlled by the experimenter. Sets of individual motor units or of small groups of motor units were stimulated independently, using stimulation profiles that were strictly repeatable between trials. This permitted a rigorous quantitative comparison of EMGs that were recorded during combined activation of multiple motor filaments with EMGs that were synthesized from the algebraic summation of motor unit action potential trains generated by individual nerve filaments. These were recorded separately by individually stimulating the same filaments with the same activation profiles that were employed during combined stimulation. During combined activation of up to 10 motor filaments, experimentally recorded and computationally synthesized EMGs were virtually identical. This indicates that EMG signals indeed are the outcome of the simple algebraic summation of motor-unit action-potential trains generated by concurrently active motor units. For both recorded and synthesized EMGs, it was confirmed that EMG magnitude increased nonlinearly with the ensemble activation rate of a pool of motor units. The nonlinearity was largely abolished when EMG magnitude was estimated as the sum of rectified, instead of raw, motor-unit action-potential trains. This suggests that the downward nonlinearity in the EMG-ensemble activation rate relation is due to signal cancellation arising from the perfectly linear summation of positive and negative components of action-potential waveforms. The findings provide a much needed post hoc validation of the concept of EMG generation by strict algebraic summation of motor unit action potentials that is generally relied on in theoretical modeling studies of EMG and in EMG decomposition algorithms.},

abstract = {The activity of brain serotonergic neurons in both the pontine-mesencephalic and medullary groups is positively correlated with the level of behavioral arousal and/or the behavioral state. This, in turn, appears to be related to the level of tonic motor activity, especially as manifested in antigravity muscles and other muscle groups associated with gross motor activity. In addition, a subset of serotonergic neurons displays a further increase in activity in association with repetitive, central pattern generator mediated responses. Accumulating evidence indicates that this relation to motor activity is related both to the co-activation of the sympathetic nervous system and to the modulation of afferent inputs.},

This study design has been utilized in local and regional outcome studies in multiple sclerosis (MS) and has yielded invaluable epidemiological information. The World Wide Web now provides an excellent opportunity for an international, collaborative cohort study of MS outcomes. A web platform--MSBase--has been designed to collect prospective data on patients with MS. It is purely observational, enabling participating neurologists to contribute data on diagnosis, treatment and progress, to review anonymous aggregate data and to benchmark their patient population against other patient subsets or the entire dataset. MSBase facilitates collaborative research by allowing the online creation of investigator-initiated regional, national and international substudies. The registry aims to answer epidemiological questions that can only be addressed by prospective assessments of large patient cohorts. The registry is funded through the independent MSBase Foundation, and governed by an International Scientific Advisory Board. The MSBase Foundation commenced operations in July 2004 and since then, 22 neurologists from 11 countries have joined MSBase and are contributing 2400 patients to the total data pool.},

The phenomena of substitution and rotation among motor units of a muscle were examined in seven different muscles. Intramuscular motor unit activity and surface electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded from one of the following muscles: abductor digiti minimi, first dorsal interosseous, extensor digitorum communis, flexor and extensor carpi radialis, tibialis anterior, and soleus. The subject was asked to discharge a discernible unit at a comfortable constant or rhythmically (pseudosinusoidally) modulated rate with audio and visual feedback. Results are reported from a total of 42 sets of motor units from all seven muscles. We observed that when a subject fired a motor unit for a long period, an additional motor unit frequently started to discharge after a few minutes. When the subject was asked to keep activity down to one unit, very often it was Unit 1 that dropped and Unit 2 continued to fire. Whereas Unit 2 had fired for a few minutes, Unit 1 resumed firing without any conscious effort by the subject. If the subject was then asked to retain just one unit, it was Unit 2 that dropped. Rhythmic modulation of firing rate of a tonically firing unit showed that whereas the threshold of this unit increased, the threshold of a phasically discharging unit decreased substantially. The increase in threshold of a tonically discharging unit is suggested to arise from inactivation of Na+ and Ca2+ channels and the decrease in threshold of higher-threshold units is suggested to arise from an increase in persistent inward currents that may occur during prolonged contractions. Whether a unit stops or starts to fire is suggested to depend on a balance between the strength of the central motor command, persistent inward currents, and inactivation of voltage-gated channels. Such rotations among low-threshold motoneurons would ensure low-level sustained contractions to be viable not only in small hand muscles but also in larger limb muscles.},

abstract = {Investigations of whole muscle and motor-unit contractile properties have provided valuable information for our understanding of the spinal cord and extraocular motor systems. However, no previous investigation has examined these properties in an isolated tongue muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine the contractile properties and muscle fiber types of the rat styloglossus muscle. The styloglossus is one of three extrinsic tongue muscles and serves to retract the tongue within the oral cavity. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 19) were used in these experiments. The contractile characteristics of the whole styloglossus muscle (n = 9) were measured in response to stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve branch to the muscle. The average twitch tension produced was 3.30 g with a mean twitch contraction time of 13.81 ms. The mean maximum tetanic tension was 19.66 g and occurred at or near the fusion frequency, which averaged 109 Hz. The styloglossus muscle was resistant to fatigue [fatigue index (F. I.) = 0.76]. In separate experiments (n = 7), the contractile characteristics of 37 single motor units were measured in response to extracellular stimulation of hypoglossal motoneurons. The twitch tension generated by styloglossus motor units averaged 35.7 mg, and the mean twitch contraction time was 12.46 ms. The mean fusion frequency was 92 Hz. Maximum tetanic tension averaged 177.8 mg. Styloglossus single motor units were resistant to fatigue (F. I. = 0.74). The sites of stimulation that yielded a contractile response in the styloglossus muscle were consistent with the location of the styloglossus motoneuron pool reported in earlier anatomy studies. Muscle fiber typing was determined in three animals based on the myofibrillar ATPase reaction at pH 9.8, 4.6, and 4.3. The styloglossus muscle was composed of approximate to 99{\%} type IIA fibers with a few scattered type I fibers present in the study sample. On the basis of the combined findings of the physiology and histochemistry experiments, the styloglossus muscle appeared to he a homogeneous muscle composed almost exclusively of fast, fatigue-resistant motor units. These properties of the styloglossus muscle and its motor units were compared with findings in other rat skeletal muscles.},

abstract = {Information processing in the brain is thought to rely on the convergence and divergence of oscillatory behaviors of widely distributed brain areas. This information flow is captured in its simplest form via the concepts of synchronization and desynchronization and related metrics. More complex forms of information flow are transient synchronizations and multi-frequency behaviors with metrics related to cross-frequency coupling (CFC). It is supposed that CFC plays a crucial role in the organization of large-scale networks and functional integration across large distances. In this study, we describe different CFC measures and test their applicability in simulated and real electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained during resting state. For these purposes, we derive generic oscillator equations from full brain network models. We systematically model and simulate the various scenarios of CFC under the influence of noise to obtain biologically realistic oscillator dynamics. We find that (i) specific CFC-measures detect correctly in most cases the nature of CFC under noise conditions, (ii) bispectrum (BIS) and bicoherence (BIC) correctly detect the CFCs in simulated data, (iii) empirical resting state EEG show a prominent delta-alpha CFC as identified by specific CFC measures and the more classic BIS and BIC. This coupling was mostly asymmetric (directed) and generally higher in the eyes closed (EC) than in the eyes open (EO) condition. In conjunction, these two sets of measures provide a powerful toolbox to reveal the nature of couplings from experimental data and as such allow inference on the brain state dependent information processing. Methodological advantages of using CFC measures and theoretical significance of delta and alpha interactions during resting and other brain states are discussed.},

The relations between (a) L in each ankle plantarflexor muscle and d(AT), (b) L in each knee extensor muscle and d(PT), and (c) d(AT) and d(PT,) were analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficients. There was no significant relation (P>0.05) between any of the above parameters, with the correlation coefficient values ranging from -0.2 to 0.29. These results contradict previous findings that L scales with d, indicating that skeletal size differences between individuals may not always be associated with predictable differences in muscle architecture. This needs to be accounted for when information about the L/d ratio of a given muscle-joint in a given individual is required, as for example is the case when assessing the suitability of a potential donor muscle in surgical tendon transfer.},

abstract = {Recordings from primary motor cortex (M1) during periods of steady contraction show oscillatory activity; these oscillations are coherent with the activity of contralateral muscles. We investigated synchronization of corticospinal output neurons with the oscillations, which could provide the pathway for their transmission to the spinal motoneurons. One hundred seventy-six antidromically identified pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) were recorded from M1 in three macaque monkeys trained to perform a precision grip task. Local field potentials (LFP) were simultaneously recorded. All analysis was confined to the hold period of the task, where our previous work has shown that there is the strongest oscillatory activity. Coherence was calculated between LFP and PTN discharge. Significant coherence was seen in three bands, with frequencies of 10-14, 17-31, and 34-44 Hz. Coherence values were low, with the majority of PTN-LFP coherences having a peak lower than 0.05. The phase of coherence was approximately -pi/2 radians for each band (with LFP polarity defined as negative upward), although there was some dispersion of phase across the population of PTNs. Coherence was also calculated between pairs of PTNs that had been simultaneously recorded. Where there was significant coherence, it was also generally smaller than 0.05. The phase of PTN-PTN coherence clustered around zero radians. A computer model was constructed to assist the interpretation of the experimental results. It simulated an integrate-and-fire neuron responding to synaptic inputs. A fraction of the synaptic inputs was synchronized with a simulated LFP; the remainder were uncorrelated with it. The model showed that coherence between the LFP and the output spike train considerably underestimated the fraction of synchronized inputs. Additionally, for a given fraction of synchronized inputs, coherence was smaller for high- compared with low-frequency bins. Cell discharge rate also influenced the spike-LFP coherence: coherence was higher for simulations in which the cell discharged at a faster rate. Thus although levels of PTN-LFP coherence seen experimentally were low, a considerable proportion of the input to the PTN must be synchronized with the global oscillatory activity recorded by the LFP. The low LFP-PTN coherences do however indicate that cortical oscillations are transmitted with only low fidelity in the discharge of a single PTN. Using further computer simulations, it was demonstrated that a small population of PTNs could encode the cortical oscillatory signal effectively, since the action of averaging across the population improves the signal:noise ratio. The oscillations will therefore be effectively transmitted to spinal motoneurons, and this has important consequences for the possible role of oscillations in motor control of the hand.},

Tactile stimulation of the hand evokes remarkably precise patterns of neural activity, suggesting that the timing of individual spikes may convey information. However, many aspects of the transformation of mechanical deformations of the skin into spike trains remain unknown. Here we describe an integrate-and-fire model that accurately predicts the timing of individual spikes evoked by arbitrary mechanical vibrations in three types of mechanoreceptive afferent fibers that innervate the hand. The model accounts for most known properties of the three fiber types, including rectification, frequency-sensitivity, and patterns of spike entrainment as a function of stimulus frequency. These results not only shed light on the mechanisms of mechanotransduction but can be used to provide realistic tactile feedback in upper-limb neuroprostheses.},

The presence of plateau potentials can also allow neurons to fire in a bistable manner, i.e., shifting between stable low and high firing frequencies. Such a bistable firing behavior has been found in soleus motor units in unrestrained rats. In the present study single motor-unit activity was recorded from low-threshold units in human soleus and tibialis anterior muscles to evaluate whether a bistable firing behavior and/or prolonged firing could be evoked. Vibration of the homonymous muscle tendon (30-100 Hz, 2-10 a) was used as excitatory input to the motoneuron pool. Brief excitation while the muscle was electrically silent induced firing during the vibration and sometimes recruited units into prolonged stable firing outlasting the vibratory stimulus. However, a bistable firing behavior, i.e., vibration-induced maintained shifts between two stable levels of firing, could not be convincingly demonstrated. The reason for this was twofold. First, low-threshold human motor units tended to jump to a "preferred firing range" shortly after voluntary recruitment. This firing range was the same as when units were recruited from silence into prolonged firing by vibration. Below the preferred firing range, maintained firing was unstable and usually only possible when subjects were listening to the spike potentials or had visual force-feedback. Second, vibration when units were firing in the preferred firing range caused a transient increase in firing frequency but no maintained frequency shifts. Recordings from pairs of motor units showed that short-lasting vibration could recruit one unit into prolonged firing, while a second unit, which already fired in its preferred firing range, only transiently increased its firing rate during the vibration. This suggests that the prolonged firing was not the result of an increase in the common synaptic drive to the motoneuron pool. We conclude that a bistable firing behavior as seen in intact rats is probably absent in human low-threshold motor units, but that prolonged firing could be seen in response to shea-lasting excitation. This latter phenomenon is compatible with the existence of plateau potentials, which have to have a threshold close to the threshold for sodium spike generation.},

Because it involves a complex interaction between two of the most intricate biological systems, immune system and CNS, animal modeling has been critical for addressing MS pathogenesis. MS models were originally developed serendipitously more than 75 years ago. Immune-mediated, toxic, viral and genetic models of demyelination are now used to understand the manifold aspects of MS. MS treatments evolved in part from animal model research, and further progress is envisaged in large part because these systems have been continually refined and their use focused on questions whose relevance was established by studying the human disease.},

abstract = {Disordered reflex activity and alterations in the neural control of walking have been observed after stroke. In addition to impairments in leg movement that affect locomotor ability after stroke, significant impairments are also seen in the arms. Altered neural control in the upper limb can often lead to altered tone and spasticity resulting in impaired coordination and flexion contractures. We sought to address the extent to which the neural control of movement is disordered after stroke by examining the modulation pattern of cutaneous reflexes in arm muscles during arm cycling. Twenty-five stroke participants who were at least 6 mo postinfarction and clinically stable, performed rhythmic arm cycling while cutaneous reflexes were evoked with trains (5 × 1.0-ms pulses at 300 Hz) of constant-current electrical stimulation to the superficial radial (SR) nerve at the wrist. Both the more (MA) and less affected (LA) arms were stimulated in separate trials. Bilateral electromyography (EMG) activity was recorded from muscles acting at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Analysis was conducted on averaged reflexes in 12 equidistant phases of the movement cycle. Phase-modulated cutaneous reflexes were present, but altered, in both MA and LA arms after stroke. Notably, the pattern was "blunted" in the MA arm in stroke compared with control participants. Differences between stroke and control were progressively more evident moving from shoulder to wrist. The results suggest that a reduced pattern of cutaneous reflex modulation persists during rhythmic arm movement after stroke. The overall implication of this result is that the putative spinal contributions to rhythmic human arm movement remain accessible after stroke, which has translational implications for rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by inflammation and degeneration within the CNS. Over the course of the disease, most MS patients successively accumulate inflammatory lesions, axonal damage, and a rather diffuse CNS pathology, along with an increasing degree of disability. Pharmacological treatment options which are currently approved for MS aim at limiting inflammation and decreasing the relapse rate, or at simply relieving symptoms. Established disease-modifying and immunosuppressive treatments are unable to prevent the accumulation of pathology in most patients over long-term. Therefore, therapies promoting the innate ability of the CNS to compensate for dysfunction resulting from brain injury might be highly beneficial in MS. As a precondition, however, development of such strategies requires well-grounded knowledge about the extent to which central plasticity is intact and accessible in MS patients, and whether it is functionally relevant at all. This review will focus on plasticity of the motor system in patients with MS. A number of functional imaging studies have assessed patterns of brain activation during simple motor tasks in MS patients and their relationship with CNS damage and motor function. Deeper insights about causal and functional relationships were gained by neurophysiological techniques, predominantly by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In addition, and probably closest to rehabilitative approaches, practice-induced plasticity has been probed in a few studies. Altogether, there is growing evidence for a preservation of rapid-onset motor plasticity and for functionally relevant chronic reorganization processes, which might be limited by high CNS injury in advanced stages of the disease. Clinical implications of these findings with regard to the development and optimization of rehabilitative treatments in MS are discussed, as well as open questions which need to be addressed by future studies. ?? 2014 IBRO.},

abstract = {The increase in complexity of computational neuron models makes the hand tuning of model parameters more difficult than ever. Fortunately, the parallel increase in computer power allows scientists to automate this tuning. Optimization algorithms need two essential components. The first one is a function that measures the difference between the output of the model with a given set of parameter and the data. This error function or fitness function makes the ranking of different parameter sets possible. The second component is a search algorithm that explores the parameter space to find the best parameter set in a minimal amount of time. In this review we distinguish three types of error functions: feature-based ones, point-by-point comparison of voltage traces and multi-objective functions. We then detail several popular search algorithms, including brute-force methods, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, differential evolution and particle-swarm optimization. Last, we shortly describe Neurofitter, a free software package that combines a phase-plane trajectory density fitness function with several search algorithms.},

The support surface and visual surround were sway-referenced to anterior/posterior center of mass sway and the gain between postural sway and degree of sway referencing was manipulated (gain settings were 0.2, 1.0, and 1.8). These alterations in the sensory environment lead to observed changes in the temporal structure of the center of pressure (COP) trajectories. COP path length increased across gain settings while COP coefficient of variation decreased. The COP became increasingly more deterministic across more challenging sensory organization test (SOT) conditions and with increasing gain, and more nonstationary across more challenging SOT conditions and when the support surface was sway-referenced using a 1.8 gain setting. These findings indicate that changes in the responsiveness of the support surface and/or visual surround within each of the sway-referenced SOT conditions had functional consequences for the control of posture as evidenced by the variations in postural sway dynamics.},

abstract = {Children with secondary dystonia due to cerebral palsy (CP) often exhibit excess variability in their movements. To investigate the relationship between excess variability and single-joint control in these children, we compared their force variations during single-joint isometric tasks to age-matched controls. Subjects performed isometric biceps contractions at six target force levels scaled to their maximum voluntary contraction. Similar studies in healthy adults have shown that movement variability exhibits characteristics of signal-dependent noise (SDN). We look for the first time at whether variability in single-joint force contractions in healthy children and children with CP exhibit similar characteristics of SDN. Results showed that compared to controls, patients exhibited increased variability (standard deviation about the mean), increased force error bias (difference between the mean and target), and increased dependence of force error bias on target force level. Signal-dependence of the noise was significant only in healthy subjects due to the higher overall variability in the patients. A control experiment using filtered visual feedback confirmed that overcorrection for perceived error was not the cause of the observed variability. These results contribute to a better understanding of movement variability in childhood dystonia and have potential use in therapeutic interventions designed to increase force production reliability.},

abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation can generate contractions through peripheral and central mechanisms. Direct activation of motor axons (peripheral mechanism) recruits motor units in an unnatural order, with fatigable muscle fibers often activated early in contractions. The activation of sensory axons can produce contractions through a central mechanism, providing excitatory synaptic input to spinal neurons that recruit motor units in the natural order. Presently, we quantified the effect of stimulation frequency (10-100 Hz), duration (0.25-2 s of high-frequency bursts, or 20 s of constant-frequency stimulation), and intensity [1-5{\%} maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque generated by a brief 100-Hz train] on the torque generated centrally. Electrical stimulation (1-ms pulses) was delivered over the triceps surae in eight subjects, and plantar flexion torque was recorded. Stimulation frequency, duration, and intensity all influenced the magnitude of the central contribution to torque. Central torque did not develop at frequencies !;20 Hz, and it was maximal at frequencies :80 Hz. Increasing the duration of high-frequency stimulation increased the central contribution to torque, as central torque developed over I I s. Central torque was greatest at a relatively low contraction intensity. The largest amount of central torque was produced by a 20-s, 100-Hz train (10.7 +/- 5.5 {\%}MVC) and by repeated 2-s bursts of 80- or 100-Hz stimulation (9.2 +/- 4.8 and 10.2 +/- 8.1{\%} MVC, respectively). Therefore, central torque was maximized by applying high-frequency, long-duration stimulation while avoiding antidromic block by stimulating at a relatively low intensity. If, as hypothesized, the central mechanism primarily activates fatigue-resistant muscle fibers, generating muscle contractions through this pathway may improve rehabilitation applications.},

abstract = {Postural dual task studies have demonstrated effects of various executive function components on gait and postural control in older adults. The purpose of the study was to explore the role of inhibition during lateral step initiation. Forty older adults participated (range 70-94 y). Subjects stepped to the left or right in response to congruous and incongruous visual cues that consisted of left and right arrows appearing on left or right sides of a monitor. The timing of postural adjustments was identified by inflection points in the vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) measured separately under each foot. Step responses could be classified into preferred and non-preferred step behavior based on the number of postural adjustments that were made. Delays in onset of the first postural adjustment (PA1) and liftoff (LO) of the step leg during preferred steps progressively increased among the simple, choice, congruous and incongruous tasks, indicating interference in processing the relevant visuo-spatial cue. Incongruous cues induced subjects to make more postural adjustments than they typically would (i.e. non-preferred steps), representing errors in selection of the appropriate motor program. During these non-preferred steps, the onset of the PA1 was earlier than during the preferred steps, indicating a failure to inhibit an inappropriate initial postural adjustment. The functional consequence of the additional postural adjustments was a delay in the LO compared with steps in which they did not make an error. These results suggest that deficits in inhibitory function may detrimentally affect step decision processing, by delaying voluntary step responses.},

abstract = {Force in striated muscle is due to attachment of the heads of the myosin, the molecular motors extending from the myosin filament, to the actin filament in each half-sarcomere, the functional unit where myosin motors act in parallel. Mechanical and X-ray structural evidence indicates that at the plateau of isometric contraction (force T0), less than half of the elastic strain of the half-sarcomere is due to the strain in the array of myosin motors (s), with the remainder being accounted for by the compliance of filaments acting as linear elastic elements in series with the motor array. Early during the development of isometric force, however, the half-sarcomere compliance has been found to be less than that expected from the linear elastic model assumed above, and this non-linearity may affect the estimate of s. This question is investigated here by applying nanometre-microsecond-resolution mechanics to single intact fibres from frog skeletal muscle at 4 °C, to record the mechanical properties of the half-sarcomere throughout the development of force in isometric contraction. The results are interpreted with mechanical models to estimate the compliance of the myosin motors. Our conclusions are as follows: (i) early during the development of an isometric tetanus, an elastic element is present in parallel with the myosin motors, with a compliance of ∼200 nm MPa(-1) (∼20 times larger than the compliance of the motor array at T0); and (ii) during isometric contraction, s is 1.66 ± 0.05 nm, which is not significantly different from the value estimated with the linear elastic model.},

abstract = {Our studies have recently demonstrated that a proportional and derivative (PD) feedback controller, which takes advantage of the body's position and velocity information to regulate balance during quiet standing, can compensate for long neurological time delays and generate a control command that precedes body sway by 100-200 ms. Furthermore, PD gain pairs were identified that ensure a robust system behavior and at the same time generate dynamic responses as observed in quiet standing experiments with able-bodied subjects. The purpose of the present study was to experimentally verify that the PD controller identified in our previous study can: 1) regulate the active ankle torque to stabilize the body during quiet standing in spite of long neurological time delays and 2) generate system dynamics, i.e., a motor command and body sway fluctuation, that successfully mimic those of the physiologic system of quiet standing. Our real-time closed-loop feedback circuit consisted of a center of mass position sensor and a functional electrical stimulator that elicited contractions of the plantar flexors as determined by the aforementioned PD controller. The control system regulated upright stance of a subject who was partially de-afferented and de-efferented due to a neurological disorder called von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome (McCormick Grade III). While the subject was able to generate a motor command for the ankle joints, he could not regulate the resulting torque sufficiently due to a lack of sensory feedback and motor control. It is important to mention that a time delay was included in the closed-loop circuit of the PD controller to mimic the actual neurological time delay observed in able-bodied individuals. The experimental results of this case study suggest that the proposed PD controller in combination with a functional electrical stimulation system can regulate the active ankle torque during quiet stance and generate the same system dynamics as observed in healthy individuals. While these findings do not imply that the CNS actually applies a PD-like control strategy to regulate balance, they suggest that it is at least theoretically possible.},

abstract = {Threshold tracking was used to compare excitability properties (stimulus-response curves, strength-duration properties, recovery cycle and threshold electrotonus) of the median nerve in 11 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and 25 healthy controls. Stimulus-response curves were significantly different: threshold was much higher, the slope of the curves reduced and the spread of the thresholds greater in the CIDP group. The strength-duration time constant (tau(SD)) was significantly shorter and the rheobase higher in the CIDP group. In the recovery cycle, the CIDP group had less refractoriness, supernormality and late subnormality than healthy controls, but the duration of the relatively refractory period was normal. These changes in tau(SD) and the recovery cycle were not those previously predicted. There were no consistent changes in threshold electrotonus, suggesting that, for the studied axons, there are no consistent changes in accommodation properties that depend on internodal conductances. It is difficult to explain these changes in excitability on the basis of a change in membrane potential, or solely as the result of demyelination, and it is possible that other morphological factors such as variable remyelination and inflammatory oedema affected axonal excitability in the patients.},

By combining and expanding mathematical descriptions from motor units to limb kinematics, the model constitutes the first attempt to simulate the surface EMG and the individual motor unit activity under the influence of descending voluntary command, oscillatory noise in the descending signal, and afferent feedback when controlling a freely moving limb to achieve a predefined angular trajectory. The oscillatory noise was adjusted to simulate various types of pathological tremor. The simulations replicated previously reported experimental results for the power spectral density of the surface EMG, the angular velocity of the limb, and single motor unit activity. The model provides a powerful tool for extracting information about how the surface EMG can be used to describe tremor in various conditions, including different tremor frequencies and intensities, that cannot be achieved solely with experimental approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare seven models on their ability to fit isometric muscle force. We stimulated the ankle dorsiflexors of eight subjects at seven ankle angles (85 degrees-120 degrees). Three different stimulation patterns (twitch, triangular, and random) were applied at all ankle angles. Four additional patterns (doublets, steady rates, "catch property," and walking-like) were applied at 95 degrees. Parameter values were optimized for each model at each angle. Parameters for the general linear model were calculated using a novel least-squares algorithm. A linear, second-order critically damped model gave the poorest fits (average root mean square (rms) error: 15 N). The models of Ding et al. (2002) and Bobet and Stein (1998) gave the best fits (average rms errors: 9.2 and 9.4 N). The other models (general linear second-order model, Wiener model, Zhou et al. (1995) model, general linear model) gave intermediate results. Results were similar at all ankle angles. We conclude that the Ding and Bobet-Stein models are the best overall for isometric contractions, that no linear model of any kind will give an error less than 9{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximum force, and that the models tested are consistent across lengths.},

abstract = {Postural sway, i.e., center of pressure and center of mass (CoM) and electromyograms (EMGs) from ankle muscles were measured during human quiet stance. It was confirmed that EMG activity of ankle extensors correlated with the CoM and CoM velocity, as reported earlier. However, the EMG activity was phasic and burst-like, compared to slow and smooth changes in CoM. It was demonstrated that the phasic EMG activity tended to appear only at specific periods mostly when the acceleration of CoM was close to zero and to terminate when CoM velocity changed its sign from positive to negative. We claimed that a simulated human stance model with a conventional PID feedback controller could not account for such phasic EMG activity. The phasic EMG activity was then associated with the active ankle torque, which is defined as the residual component of the stiffness torque in the total ankle torque. To this end, the active torque was estimated by assuming that the ankle stiffness was not large enough to make the upright posture asymptotically stable. The active torque and the phasic EMG activity were sharply correlated, implying that the phasic EMG activity might generate the active torque, and it might be produced based on a strategy other than the conventional PID feedback control.},

abstract = {Dexterous manipulation depends on using the fingertips to stabilize unstable objects. The Strength-Dexterity paradigm consists of asking subjects to compress a slender and compliant spring prone to buckling. The maximal level of compression [requiring low fingertip forces <300 grams force (gf)] quantifies the neural control capability to dynamically regulate fingertip force vectors and motions for a dynamic manipulation task. We found that finger dexterity is significantly affected by age (p = 0.017) and gender (p = 0.021) in 147 healthy individuals (66F, 81M, 20-88 years). We then measured finger dexterity in 42 hands of patients following treatment for osteoarthritis of the base of the thumb (CMC OA, 33F, 65.8 ± 9.7 years), and 31 hands from patients being treated for Parkinson's disease (PD, 6F, 10M, 67.68 ± 8.5 years). Importantly, we found no differences in finger compression force among patients or controls. However, we did find stronger age-related declines in performance in the patients with PD (slope -2.7 gf/year, p = 0.002) than in those with CMC OA (slope -1.4 gf/year, p = 0.015), than in controls (slope -0.86 gf/year). In addition, the temporal variability of forces during spring compression shows clearly different dynamics in the clinical populations compared to the controls (p < 0.001). Lastly, we compared dexterity across extremities. We found stronger age (p = 0.005) and gender (p = 0.002) effects of leg compression force in 188 healthy subjects who compressed a larger spring with the foot of an isolated leg (73F, 115M, 14-92 years). In 81 subjects who performed the tests with all four limbs separately, we found finger and leg compression force to be significantly correlated (females $\rho$ = 0.529, p = 0.004; males $\rho$ = 0.403, p = 0.003; 28F, 53M, 20-85 years), but surprisingly found no differences between dominant and non-dominant limbs. These results have important clinical implications, and suggest the existence - and compel the investigation - of systemic versus limb-specific mechanisms for dexterity.},

abstract = {In many recent human motor control models, including feedback-error learning and adaptive model theory (AMT), feedback control is used to correct errors while an inverse model is simultaneously tuned to provide accurate feedforward control. This popular and appealing hypothesis, based on a combination of psychophysical observations and engineering considerations, predicts that once the tuning of the inverse model is complete the role of feedback control is limited to the correction of disturbances. This hypothesis was tested by looking at the open-loop behavior of the human motor system during adaptation. An experiment was carried out involving 20 normal adult subjects who learned a novel visuomotor relationship on a pursuit tracking task with a steering wheel for input. During learning, the response cursor was periodically blanked, removing all feedback about the external system (i.e., about the relationship between hand motion and response cursor motion). Open-loop behavior was not consistent with a progressive transfer from closed- to open-loop control. Our recently developed computational model of the brain--a novel nonlinear implementation of AMT--was able to reproduce the observed closed- and open-loop results. In contrast, other control-systems models exhibited only minimal feedback control following adaptation, leading to incorrect open-loop behavior. This is because our model continues to use feedback to control slow movements after adaptation is complete. This behavior enhances the internal stability of the inverse model. In summary, our computational model is currently the only motor control model able to accurately simulate the closed- and open-loop characteristics of the experimental response trajectories.},

abstract = {We investigated the changes in muscle fiber conduction velocity, recruitment and derecruitment thresholds, and discharge rate of low-threshold motor units during a series of ramp contractions. The aim was to compare the adjustments in motor unit activity relative to the duration that each motor unit was active during the task. Multichannel surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle of eight healthy men during 12-s contractions (n = 25) in which the force increased and decreased linearly from 0 to 10{\%} of the maximum. The maximal force exhibited a modest decline (8.5 +/- 9.3{\%}; P < 0.05) at the end of the task. The discharge times of 73 motor units that were active for 16-98{\%} of the time during the first five contractions were identified throughout the task by decomposition of the EMG signals. Action potential conduction velocity decreased during the task by a greater amount for motor units that were initially active for >70{\%} of the time compared with that of less active motor units. Moreover, recruitment and derecruitment thresholds increased for these most active motor units, whereas the thresholds decreased for the less active motor units. Another 18 motor units were recruited at an average of 171 +/- 32 s after the beginning of the task. The recruitment and derecruitment thresholds of these units decreased during the task, but muscle fiber conduction velocity did not change. These results indicate that low-threshold motor units exhibit individual adjustments in muscle fiber conduction velocity and motor neuron activation that depended on the relative duration of activity during intermittent contractions.},

abstract = {Postural control of upright stance was investigated in well-compensated, unilateral vestibular loss (UVL) subjects compared to age-matched control subjects. The goal was to determine how sensory weighting for postural control in UVL subjects differed from control subjects, and how sensory weighting related to UVL subjects' functional compensation, as assessed by standardized balance and dizziness questionnaires. Postural control mechanisms were identified using a model-based interpretation of medial-lateral center-of-mass body-sway evoked by support-surface rotational stimuli during eyes-closed stance. The surface-tilt stimuli consisted of continuous pseudorandom rotations presented at four different amplitudes. Parameters of a feedback control model were obtained that accounted for each subject's sway response to the surface-tilt stimuli. Sensory weighting factors quantified the relative contributions to stance control of vestibular sensory information, signaling body-sway relative to earth-vertical, and proprioceptive information, signaling body-sway relative to the surface. Results showed that UVL subjects made significantly greater use of proprioceptive, and therefore less use of vestibular, orientation information on all tests. There was relatively little overlap in the distributions of sensory weights measured in UVL and control subjects, although UVL subjects varied widely in the amount they could use their remaining vestibular function. Increased reliance on proprioceptive information by UVL subjects was associated with their balance being more disturbed by the surface-tilt perturbations than control subjects, thus indicating a deficiency of balance control even in well-compensated UVL subjects. Furthermore, there was some tendency for UVL subjects who were less able to utilize remaining vestibular information to also indicate worse functional compensation on questionnaires.},

Nineteen healthy males subjects were divided into a neuromuscular electrostimulated group (n = 12) and a control group (n = 7). The training program consisted of 15 sessions of isometric NMES over a 5-wk period. All subjects were tested before and after the 5-wk period. SOL, lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) maximal H-reflex and M-wave potentials were evoked at rest (i.e., H(max) and M(max), respectively) and during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) (i.e., H(sup) and M(sup), respectively). During MVC, a supramaximal stimulus was delivered that allowed us to record the V-wave peak-to-peak amplitudes from all three muscles. The SOL, LG, and MG electromyographic (EMG) activity as well as muscle activation (twitch interpolation technique) were also quantified during MVC. After training, plantar flexor MVC increased significantly by 22{\%} (P < 0.001). Torque gains were accompanied by an increase in muscle activation (+11{\%}, P < 0.05), SOL, LG, and MG normalized EMG activity (+51, +54, and +60{\%}, respectively, P < 0.05) and V/M(sup) ratios (+81, +76, and +97{\%}, respectively, P < 0.05). H(max)/M(max) and H(sup)/M(sup) ratios for all three muscles were unchanged after training. In conclusion, the increase in voluntary torque after 5 wk of NMES training could be ascribed to an increased volitional drive from the supraspinal centers and/or adaptations occurring at the spinal level.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Balance control under static and dynamic conditions was assessed in patients with Sensory Neuron Disease (SND) in order to shed further light on the pathophysiology of ataxia. METHODS: Fourteen patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and 11 with SND underwent clinical and neurophysiological evaluation, stabilometric recording of body sway during quiet stance with and without vision, stereometric analysis of body segment displacement while riding a platform translating in anterior-posterior direction with and without vision (dynamic condition), and EMG recording of leg muscle responses to abrupt stance perturbation produced by rotation of a supporting platform. The findings were compared to those of age matched normal subjects. RESULTS: Clinical and neurophysiological evaluation revealed a more severe motor impairment in patients with diabetes than SND, while sensory impairment was superimposable. Some patients with SND had vestibular dysfunction of diverse severity. Body sway during stance was larger in patients with SND than diabetes with and without vision. In the stance perturbation condition, the latency of the long-loop EMG response to platform rotation was disproportionately increased with respect to the spinal response in the SND but not in diabetic patients. Under dynamic condition, patients with SND oscillated more than diabetic patients and several of them easily lost balance with eyes closed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SND show severe unsteadiness under both static and dynamic conditions, particularly with eyes closed. The patchy sensory loss of SND, disrupting sensation from territories other than the lower limbs and possibly including the vestibular nerve, could be responsible for this instability. Ataxia is correlated to the abnormal latency of the muscle responses to stance perturbation. Since increased response latencies cannot be attributed to a vestibular deficit, the deterioration of equilibrium control would be ascribed mainly to the degeneration of the central branch of the afferent fibres. SIGNIFICANCE: Measures of body balance under quiet stance and dynamic conditions can provide relevant diagnostic information as to the pathophysiology and severity of ataxia and viability of the central branch of the sensory fibres, and help in separating patients with peripheral neuropathy from patients with loss of sensory neurones.},

@article{Neilson2010,
abstract = {Recently Latash, Scholz, and Schoner (2007) proposed a new view of motor synergies which stresses the idea that the nervous system does not seek a unique solution to eliminate redundant degrees of freedom but rather uses redundant sets of elemental variables that each correct for errors in the other to achieve a performance goal. This is an attractive concept because the resulting flexibility in the synergy also provides for performance stability. But although Latash et al. construe this concept as the consequence of a "neural organization" they do not say what that may be, nor how it comes about. Adaptive model theory (AMT) is a computational theory developed in our laboratory to account for observed sensory-motor behavior. It gives a detailed account, in terms of biologically feasible neural adaptive filters, of the formation of motor synergies and control of synergistic movements. This account is amplified here to show specifically how the processes within the AMT computational framework lead directly to the flexibility/stability ratios of Latash et al. (2007). Accordingly, we show that quantitative analyses of experimental data, based on the uncontrolled manifold method, do not and indeed cannot refute the possibility that the nervous system tries to find a unique (optimal) solution to eliminate redundant degrees of freedom. We show that the desirable interplay between flexibility and stability demonstrated by uncontrolled manifold analysis can be equally well achieved by a system that forms and deploys optimized motor synergies, as in AMT.

abstract = {The present work was designed to investigate presynaptic modulation of Ia afferents in the extensor (ECR) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) when the two muscles acted as synergists during radial deviation to either support an inertial load (position task) or exert an equivalent constant torque against a rigid restraint (force task). H reflexes were evoked in the ECR and FCR by stimulating at the elbow level (1-ms duration) the radial and median nerves, respectively. Conditioning stimulation was applied to the median and radial nerves at the elbow level to assess presynaptic inhibition of homonymous Ia afferent input (D1 inhibition) from the ECR and FCR, respectively. The ongoing presynaptic inhibition of heteronymous Ia afferents that converges onto ECR and FCR motor neuron pools (heteronymous Ia facilitation) was assessed by stimulating the median nerve at the wrist level (palmar branch) prior to the stimulus applied over the radial or median nerve. The heteronymous monosynaptic Ia facilitation was greater (P < 0.05) during the position task (ECR 121{\%}; FCR 147{\%}) compared with the force task (ECR 115{\%}; FCR 132{\%}), and was paralleled by the depression of D1 inhibition (P < 0.05) during the position task (ECR 75.4{\%}; FCR 79.0{\%}) compared with force task (ECR 58.7{\%}; FCR 58.8{\%}). These data indicate that Ia presynaptic inhibition is reduced during the position task relative to the force task. Such differential modulation of Ia afferent input onto the motor neuron pool likely reflects the requirement to heighten reflex responsiveness during the unstable task of maintaining limb position.},

abstract = {A large inter-individual variation is seen in muscle fascicle length of the athletes but the reasons for this phenomenon are unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors contribute to the variances in muscle architectural characteristics. Nine monozygous twin pairs (3 males and 6 females), mean age 23 years (range 17-40) were studied. Fascicle length, pennation angle, and muscle thickness of the medial (MG) and lateral (LG) gastrocnemius muscles were measured in vivo by B-mode ultrasound. In the LG muscle intrapair resemblance (P < 0.01) for fascicle length (r = 0.98), pennation angle (r = 0.94) and muscle thickness (r = 0.86) were observed. In MG muscle, however, there was no intrapair resemblance for fascicle length (r = 0.66, P > 0.05), although pennation angle (r = 0.73, P < 0.05) and muscle thickness (r = 0.86, P < 0.01) were significant. Mean percent intrapair difference in LG and MG muscles were 1.8{\%} and 5.1{\%} for fascicle length, 11.3{\%} and 12.3{\%} for pennation angle and 12.4{\%} and 9.9{\%} for muscle thickness, respectively. There is intrapair difference between muscle thickness and pennation angle in both MG (r = 0.69, P < 0.05) and LG (r = 0.70, P < 0.05) muscles. However, no significant correlation was observed for intrapair difference between muscle thickness and fascicle length in both muscles (MG, r = 0.46; LG, r = 0.40). It appears that genetic predisposition is the predominant factor for the determination of muscle fascicle length. However, a lack of intrapair resemblance in MG fascicle length raises the possibility that fascicle length may be further influenced by external environmental factors such as physical training.},

abstract = {Muscle fatigue is an exercise-induced reduction in maximal voluntary muscle force. It may arise not only because of peripheral changes at the level of the muscle, but also because the central nervous system fails to drive the motoneurons adequately. Evidence for "central" fatigue and the neural mechanisms underlying it are reviewed, together with its terminology and the methods used to reveal it. Much data suggest that voluntary activation of human motoneurons and muscle fibers is suboptimal and thus maximal voluntary force is commonly less than true maximal force. Hence, maximal voluntary strength can often be below true maximal muscle force. The technique of twitch interpolation has helped to reveal the changes in drive to motoneurons during fatigue. Voluntary activation usually diminishes during maximal voluntary isometric tasks, that is central fatigue develops, and motor unit firing rates decline. Transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex during fatiguing exercise has revealed focal changes in cortical excitability and inhibitability based on electromyographic (EMG) recordings, and a decline in supraspinal "drive" based on force recordings. Some of the changes in motor cortical behavior can be dissociated from the development of this "supraspinal" fatigue. Central changes also occur at a spinal level due to the altered input from muscle spindle, tendon organ, and group Ill and IV muscle afferents innervating the fatiguing muscle. Some intrinsic adaptive properties of the motoneurons help to minimize fatigue. A number of other central changes occur during fatigue and affect, for example, proprioception, tremor, and postural control. Human muscle fatigue does not simply reside in the muscle.},

Data from 8 male and 8 female Subjects were collected in increments of approximately 25{\%} of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) ranging from rest to MVC. A significant positive linear relationship (p < 0.05) between normalized EMG and pennation angle for all muscles was observed when subject specific pennation angles at rest and MVC were included in the analysis. These were included to account for gender differences and inter-subject variability in pennation angle. The coefficient of determination, R-2, ranged between 0.76 for the TA and 0.87 for the SOL. The EMG-pennation angle relationships have ramifications for use in EMG-driven models of muscle force. The regression equations can be used to characterize fiber pennation angle more accurately and to determine how it changes with contraction intensity, thus providing improved estimates of muscle force when using musculoskeletal models.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since patients with large-fibre neuropathy do not show abnormal body sway during stance, the hypothesis was tested that postural control is not impaired until myelinated fibres of medium size are affected. METHODS: In 22 diabetic neuropathic patients and 13 normals, we recorded: (1) body sway area (SA), (2) stretch responses of soleus (Sol) and flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) to toe-up rotation of a platform, (3) Sol and FDB H reflex and FDB F wave, (4) conduction velocity (CV) of tibial, deep peroneal and sural nerve. In patients, detection thresholds for vibration, cooling (CDT), warming and heat-pain (HPDT) were assessed. RESULTS: Body SA was increased in patients with respect to normals. Toe-up rotation elicited short- (SLR) and medium-latency (MLR) responses in Sol and FDB in all normals. In patients, SLR was absent in FDB and reduced in Sol, and MLR was delayed in both muscles; the FDB H reflex was absent. The CV of tibial nerve group II afferent fibres, as estimated from the afferent time of FDB MLR, was reduced in patients. All sensory detection thresholds were increased. Stepwise multiple regression showed that increased SA was explained by increased latency of MLR, decreased CV of group II fibres and augmented CDT and HPDT. CONCLUSIONS: Unsteadiness in diabetic neuropathy is related to alterations in medium-size myelinated afferent fibres, possibly originating from spindle secondary terminations.},

Subjects stood on a force platform or on a board with a narrow support surface ("unstable board") and performed voluntary cyclic shifts of the COP at different frequencies. Movement sway was typically higher than postural sway; sway in the mediolateral direction was particularly increased. Movement sway showed a drop with the frequency of voluntary COP shifts. During standing on the unstable board, postural sway increased while movement sway decreased. The effects of task parameters were stronger on the sway component in the direction of the voluntary COP shift than in the orthogonal direction. We interpret changes in movement sway with task parameters as partly resulting from modulation of the search function of sway during voluntary COP shifts.},

abstract = {The interactive effects of length and stimulus frequency on rise and fall times and on sag were investigated in fast-twitch feline caudofemoralis at normal body temperature. The length and stimulus frequency ranges studied were 0.8-1.2 L-0 and 15-60 pps. Isometric rise times were shortest under two sets of conditions: short lengths + low stimulus frequencies and long lengths + high stimulus frequencies. In contrast the isometric fall time relationship showed a single minimum at short lengths + low stimulus frequencies. Velocity was shown to have an additional effect on fall time, but only at higher stimulus frequencies (40-60 pps): fall times were shorter during movement in either direction as compared to isometric. The effects of sag were greatest at shorter lengths and lower stimulus frequencies during isometric stimulus trains. Potential mechanisms underlying this last effect were investigated by comparing isometric twitches elicited prior to and immediately following a sag-inducing stimulus train. Post-sag twitches produced less force, reached peak force earlier and initially decayed more quickly compared to pre-sag twitches. However, the final rate of force decay and the initial rate of force rise (during the first 15 ms) were unaffected by sag. We construct a logical argument based on these findings to hypothesize that the predominant mechanism underlying sag is an increase in the rate of sarcoplasmic calcium ion removal. All of the above findings were used to construct a model of activation dynamics for fast-twitch muscle, which was then extrapolated to slow-twitch muscle. When coupled with a previous model of kinematic dynamics, the complete model produced accurate predictions of the forces actually recorded during experiments in which we applied concurrent dynamic changes in length, velocity and stimulus frequency.},

abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} syndrome is classified into acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) by electrodiagnostic and pathological criteria. In AMAN, the immune attack appears directed against the axolemma and nodes of Ranvier. Threshold tracking was used to measure indices of axonal excitability (refractoriness, supernormality, and threshold electrotonus) for median nerve axons at the wrist of patients with AMAN (n = 10) and AIDP (n = 8). Refractoriness (the increase in threshold current during the relative refractory period) was greatly increased in AMAN patients, but the abruptness of the threshold increases at short interstimulus intervals indicated conduction failure distal to the stimulation (ie, an increased refractory period of transmission). During the 4 week period from onset, the high refractoriness returned toward normal, and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential increased, consistent with improvement in the safety margin for impulse transmission in the distal nerve. In contrast, refractoriness was normal in AIDP, even though there was marked prolongation of distal latencies. Supernormality and threshold electrotonus were normal in both groups of patients, suggesting that, at the wrist, membrane potential was normal and pathology was relatively minor. These results support the view that the predominantly distal targets of immune attack are different for AMAN and AIDP. Possible mechanisms for the reduced safety factor in AMAN are discussed.},

abstract = {Why do motoneurons possess two persistent inward currents (PICs), a fast sodium current and a slow calcium current? To answer this question, we replaced the natural PICs with dynamic clamp-imposed artificial PICs at the soma of spinal motoneurons of anesthetized cats. We investigated how PICs with different kinetics (1-100 ms) amplify proprioceptive inputs. We showed that their action depends on the presence or absence of a resonance created by the I-h current. In resonant motoneurons, a fast PIC enhances the resonance and amplifies the dynamic component of Ia inputs elicited by ramp-and-hold muscle stretches. This facilitates the recruitment of these motoneurons, which likely innervate fast contracting motor units developing large forces, e. g., to restore balance or produce ballistic movements. In nonresonant motoneurons, in contrast, a fast PIC easily triggers plateau potentials, which leads to a dramatic amplification of the static component of Ia inputs. This likely facilitates the recruitment of these motoneurons, innervating mostly slowly contracting and fatigue-resistant motor units, during postural activities. Finally, a slow PIC may switch a resonant motoneuron to nonresonant by counterbalancing Ih, thus changing the action of the fast PIC. A modeling study shows that Ih needs to be located on the dendrites to create the resonance, and it predicts that dendritic PICs amplify synaptic input in the same manner as somatic PICs.},

abstract = {Upright balance is believed to be maintained through active and passive mechanisms, both of which have been shown to be impacted by aging. A compensatory balance response often observed in older adults is increased co-contraction, which is generally assumed to enhance stability by increasing joint stiffness. We investigated the effect of aging on standing balance by fitting body sway data to a previously developed postural control model that includes active and passive stiffness and damping parameters. Ten young (24 +/- 3 years) and seven older (75 +/- 5 years) adults were exposed during eyes-closed stance to perturbations consisting of lateral pseudorandom floor tilts. A least-square fit of the measured body sway data to the postural control model found significantly larger active stiffness and damping model parameters in the older adults. These differences remained significant even after normalizing to account for different body sizes between the young and older adult groups. An age effect was also found for the normalized passive stiffness, but not for the normalized passive damping parameter. This concurrent increase in active stiffness and damping was shown to be more stabilizing than an increase in stiffness alone, as assessed by oscillations in the postural control model impulse response.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare force accuracy, force variability and muscle activity during constant isometric contractions at different force levels with and without visual feedback and at different feedback gains. In experiment 1, subjects were instructed to accurately match the target force at 2, 15, 30, 50, and 70{\%} of their maximal isometric force with abduction of the index finger and maintain their force even in the absence of visual feedback. Each trial lasted 22 s and visual feedback was removed from 8-12 to 16-20 s. Each subject performed 6 trials at each target force, half with visual gain of 51.2 pixels/N and the rest with a visual gain of 12.8 pixels/N. Force error was calculated as the root mean square error of the force trace from the target line. Force variability was quantified as the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CVF) of the force trace. The EMG activity of the agonist (first dorsal interosseus; FDI) was measured with bipolar surface electrodes placed distal to the innervation zone. Independent of visual gain and force level, subjects exhibited lower force error with the visual feedback condition (2.53 +/- 2.95 vs. 2.71 +/- 2.97 N; P < 0.01); whereas, force variability was lower when visual feedback was removed (CVF: 4.06 +/- 3.11 vs. 4.47 +/- 3.14, P < 0.01). The EMG activity of the FDI muscle was higher during the visual feedback condition and this difference increased especially at higher force levels (70{\%}: 370 +/- 149 vs. 350 +/- 143 microV, P < 0.01). Experiment 2 examined whether the findings of experiment 1 were driven by the higher force levels and proximity in the gain of visual feedback. Subjects performed constant isometric contractions with the abduction of the index finger at an absolute force of 2 N, with two distinct feedback gains of 15 and 3,000 pixels/N. In agreement with the findings of experiment 1, subjects exhibited lower force error in the presence of visual feedback especially when the feedback gain was high (0.057 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.095 +/- 0.05 N). However, force variability was not affected by the vastly distinct feedback gains at this force, which supported and extended the findings from experiment 1. Our findings demonstrate that although removal of visual feedback amplifies force error, it can reduce force variability during constant isometric contractions due to an altered activation of the primary agonist muscle most likely at moderate force levels in young adults.},

@article{Enoka2012,
abstract = {Reductionist approaches have provided little insight on the fatigue experienced by humans during activities of daily living. Some of the reasons for this lack of progress include the persistence of outdated concepts, the misinterpretation of experimental recordings, and a failure to embrace a global perspective on fatigue. This paper summarizes the three examples of these limitations that were discussed in the 2011 Muybridge Award lecture: motor unit types and muscle fatigue, myoelectric manifestations of fatigue, and fatigue and fatigability. Although the motor units in a population do exhibit a range of fatigability values, there are not distinct groups of motor units and the concept that some motor units are resistant to fatigue emerged from protocols in which motor units were activated by electrical stimulation rather than voluntary activation. The concept of distinct motor unit types should be abandoned. The second example discussed in the lecture was the use of surface EMG signals to assess fatigue-related adjustments in motor unit activity. The critical assumption with this approach is that the association between surface EMG amplitude and muscle force remains constant during fatiguing contractions. Unfortunately, the relation does not remain constant and a series of computational studies demonstrate the magnitude of the discrepancy, including the absence of an association with the activation signal emerging from the spinal cord and that received by the muscle. The third example concerned the concepts of fatigue and fatigability. It has long been recognized that fatigue involves both sensations and impairments in motor function, and the final part of the lecture urged the integration of the two constructs into a single scheme in which fatigue can be modulated either independently or by interactions between perceptions of fatigue and the mechanisms that establish levels of fatigability. The expectation is that such critical evaluations of the concepts and approaches to the study of fatigue will provide a more effective foundation from which to identify the factors that contribute to fatigue in health and disease.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to test Bernstein's idea that motor synergies provide solutions to the motor redundancy problem. Forces produced by individual fingers of one hand were recorded in one-, two-, three-, and four-finger tasks. The subjects (n=10) were asked to produce maximal total force (maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) and to match a ramp total force profile using different combinations of fingers. We found that individual finger forces were smaller in multifinger MVC tasks than in single-finger tasks. The deficit increased with the number of fingers involved. A saturation effect was observed: when several effecters were involved, adding a new effector did not significantly change the total force output. The data confirmed the idea that the central neural drive arriving at the level of synergies has a certain limit, a ceiling, that cannot be exceeded. The central nervous system cannot maximally activate the muscles serving all the fingers at the same time. Secondly, during the course of ramp trials, forces produced by individual fingers were linearly related to each other. Hence, a force sharing pattern was established at the beginning of the trial and did not change during the ramp period. A hypothesis is suggested that force distribution among fingers may be organized so as to minimize unnecessary rotational moment with respect to the functional longitudinal axis of the hand. Finally, in the four-finger trials, variance of the total maximal force output in ten consecutive attempts was smaller than the sum of variances of the maximal individual finger forces. The finding suggests that the control system of the motor tasks studied involves at least two levels, a central neural drive level and a synergy level. At the synergy level, an intercompensation in individual finger force production is observed.},

abstract = {To determine whether the soleus (SOL) H-reflex is modulated during shortening contractions in a manner that has been observed for isometric contractions, SOL H-reflexes and M-waves were elicited via percutaneous electrical stimulation to the tibial nerve at an intensity that evoked an H-reflex at 50{\%} of its maximum in 11 healthy subjects. Paired electrical stimuli were delivered as the ankle angle passed through 90 degrees at an interval of 400 ms while the subject performed shortening contractions at levels of plantar flexion torque ranging between 2 and 30{\%} of that during a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). H-reflexes were also recorded during the performance of isomeric contractions of plantar flexors at similar levels of plantar flexion torque and at the same joint angle (muscle length) in an additional five healthy subjects. Correlations were examined between the peak-to-peak amplitude of the first H-reflexes, M-waves and plantar flexion torques in both protocols. It was revealed that no significant correlation was found between the SOL H-reflex and increasing plantar flexion torque during shortening contractions (rho = -0.07, P = 0.15), while a strong positive correlation was observed for the isometric conditions (rho = 0.99, P < 0.01). No significant change was observed in the SOL M-wave for either contraction type. Furthermore, the H-reflexes elicited via paired stimuli with the same background activity in voluntary shortening contractions showed almost identical amplitudes, suggesting that the level of homosynaptic post-activation depression did not change in response to the varying levels of activation in voluntary shortening contractions. Therefore, the lack of increase in the H-reflex during shortening contractions at increasing intensities is possibly due to a centrally regulated increase in presynaptic inhibition. Such a downward modulation of the reflex suggests that Ia-excitatory input onto the SOL motoneurone pool needs to be reduced during the performance of shortening contractions.},

abstract = {Electrical stimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry is believed to provide therapeutic benefits for some spinal cord injured (SCI) paraplegics and quadriplegics. However, to date these benefits have been marginal. To improve the design and increase the effectiveness of these systems it is necessary to have a better understanding of the factors that influence the force production capabilities of the stimulated muscles, the ability of the muscles to produce the desired movement, and the metabolic demands of the contractions. A dynamic musculoskeletal model capable of simulating a SCI person exercising on a stimulation- powered leg cycle ergometer was developed to explore these issues. We then used the model to address the question: Can performance be improved by changing seat configuration, the loading, or the intermuscle stimulation pattern? Performance was assessed in terms of 1) the probability that a given SCI subject would be able to maintain a steady cadence, 2) the relative strength required by each muscle group to pedal alone, and 3) the estimated rate of metabolic energy utilization associated with steady-state pedaling. We also considered the sensitivity of the model predictions to intersubject variability. Several strategies are suggested for either minimizing the strength needed to pedal, or maximizing the cardiovascular aerobic exercise.},

abstract = {Computational models of motor-unit populations are the objective implementations of the hypothesized mechanisms by which neural and muscle properties give rise to electromyograms (EMGs) and force. However, the variability/uncertainty of the parameters used in these models and how they affect predictions - confounds assessing these hypothesized mechanisms. We perform a large-scale computational sensitivity analysis on the state-of-the-art computational model of surface EMG, force, and force variability by combining a comprehensive review of published experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations. To exhaustively explore model performance and robustness, we ran numerous iterative simulations each using a random set of values for nine commonly measured motor neuron and muscle parameters. Parameter values were sampled across their reported experimental ranges. Convergence after 439 simulations found that only 3 simulations met our two fitness criteria: approximating the well-established experimental relations for the scaling of EMG amplitude and force variability with mean force. An additional 424 simulations preferentially sampling the neighborhood of those 3 valid simulations converged to reveal 65 additional sets of parameter values for which the model predictions approximate the experimentally known relations. We find the model is not sensitive to muscle properties but very sensitive to several motor neuron properties - especially peak discharge rates and recruitment ranges. Therefore to advance our understanding of EMG and muscle force, it is critical to evaluate the hypothesized neural mechanisms as implemented in today's state-of the art models of motor unit function. We discuss experimental and analytical avenues to do so as well as new features that may be added in future implementations of motor-unit models to improve their experimental validity.},

The effects of electrode configuration, electrode size and inclination of the fibers with respect to the detection system are included in the transfer function of the filter. Computation of the signal in space domain is performed by applying the Radon transform; this permits to draw considerations about spectral dips and clear misunderstandings in previous theoretical derivations. The effects of generation and extinction of the action potentials at the fiber end plate and at the tendons are included by modeling the source current, without any approximation of its shape, as a function of space and time and by using again the Radon transform. The approach, based on the separation of the temporal and spatial properties of the muscle fiber action potential and of the volume conductor, includes the capacitive tissue properties.},

Stimulation of the superficial peroneal or the sural nerve (3 shocks, 3 ms interval, 1 ms duration, 2.5 x perception threshold) evoked a reflex activation of the tibialis anterior muscle at a latency of approximately 70-95 ms in all of nine healthy human subjects. Stimulation of the medial plantar nerve only rarely produced similar effects. The possibility that a transcortical pathway contributes to these late reflex responses was investigated by combining the cutaneous stimulations and a transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex. 2. A significant facilitation of short-latency peaks in the post-stimulus time histogram of single tibialis anterior motor units evoked by the transcortical magnetic stimulation was observed in eight out of nine subjects following stimulation of the superficial peroneal or sural nerves at the latency of the long-latency reflex. In contrast such a facilitation was only rarely seen when the medial plantar nerve was stimulated. 3. With the same timing for the stimuli, the superficial peroneal and sural nerve stimulations also produced a significant increase in the short-latency, presumed monosynaptic, facilitation of the tibialis anterior H reflex produced by the brain stimulation. 4. Similar facilitatory effects of the cutaneous stimuli could not be demonstrated when the magnetic stimulation of the cortex was replaced with electrical stimulation, implying that cortical excitability is affected by a conditioning cutaneous stimulation. 5. It is suggested that the long-latency reflexes in the tibialis anterior muscle evoked by activation of cutaneous afferents from the human foot are, at least partly, mediated by a transcortical pathway.},

To achieve an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the representation of tactile stimuli in the nerve, we developed a two-stage computational model consisting of a nonlinear mechanical transduction stage followed by a generalized integrate-and-fire mechanism. The model improves upon a recently published counterpart in two important ways. First, complexity is dramatically reduced (at least one order of magnitude fewer parameters). Second, the model comprises a saturating nonlinearity and therefore can be applied to a much wider range of stimuli. We show that both the rate and timing of afferent responses are predicted with remarkable precision and that observed adaptation patterns and threshold behavior are well captured. We conclude that the responses of mechanoreceptive afferents can be understood using a very parsimonious mechanistic model, which can then be used to accurately simulate the responses of afferent populations.},

Some motor units lend themselves to longitudinal studies of their electrical and contractile characteristics. The former include the conduction velocities of their motor axons and the sizes and shapes of their motor unit action potentials and the latter such contractile characteristics of the motor unit as their contractile speeds, twitch and tetanic tensions, and resistance to fatigue. The feasibility of serially examining the same motor unit has made it possible to study the responses of single motor units to conditioning as well as changes in the responses of single motor units to diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The non-invasive character of these approaches offers an attractive means of studying the responses of single human cells, in these cases motor neurons, in health and disease.

abstract = {Corticomuscular coherence has previously been reported between primary motor cortex (M1) and contralateral muscles. We examined whether such coherence could also be seen from somatosensory areas. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from primary somatosensory cortex (S1; areas 3a and 2) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC; area 5) simultaneously with M1 LFP and forearm EMG activity in two monkeys during an index finger flexion task. Significant beta-band ( approximately 20 Hz) corticomuscular coherence was found in all areas investigated. Directed coherence (Granger causality) analysis was used to investigate the direction of effects. Surprisingly, the strongest beta-band directed coherence was in the direction from S1/PPC to muscle; it was much weaker in the ascending direction. Examination of the phase of directed coherence provided estimates of the time delay from cortex to muscle. Delays were longer from M1 ( approximately 62 ms for the first dorsal interosseous muscle) than from S1/PPC ( approximately 36 ms). We then looked at coherence and directed coherence between M1 and S1 for clues to this discrepancy. Directed coherence showed large beta-band effects from S1/PPC to M1, with smaller directed coherence in the reverse direction. The directed coherence phase suggested a delay of approximately 40 ms from M1 to S1. Corticomuscular coherence from S1/PPC could involve multiple pathways; the most important is probably common input from M1 to S1/PPC and muscles. If correct, this implies that somatosensory cortex receives oscillatory efference copy information from M1 about the motor command. This could allow sensory inflow to be interpreted in the light of its motor context.},

abstract = {This study examined the effect of caffeine on self-sustained firing (SSF) of human motor units. At physiological doses, caffeine acts as a competitive antagonist to the inhibitory effects of adenosine. This antagonism has many possible effects on the central nervous system. One of these effects is to increase the release of the excitatory neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline. In addition, caffeine increases serotonin concentration in brainstem regions that have excitatory projections to spinal motor neurons. Since plateau potentials, which are responsible for SSF, are facilitated by these neurotransmitters, we hypothesized that caffeine would increase the frequency at which SSF occurs. A double-blind, repeated-measures design using either drug (6 mg kg(-1) caffeine) or placebo (flour) was carried out on seven male subjects who reported ingesting less than 200 mg week(-1) caffeine. We investigated the occurrence of SSF in tibialis anterior motor units (214 trials) and found a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the occurrence of SSF in the caffeine trial (87.0 +/- 5.8 {\%}) compared to the placebo (64.6 +/- 9.7 {\%}). These data further verify the presence of SSF in the tibialis anterior motor units of young men and provide indirect evidence of the facilitation of plateau potentials by monoamines in the human neuromuscular system.},

abstract = {Background: There are many gaps in the understanding of the neuroanatomy of skeletal muscles with regards to the nerve distribution pattern and shape Of the muscles. This study was designed to examine the entire intramuscular nerve-distribution patterns of various human skeletal muscles. Methods: The relationships among nine skeletal muscles with various architecture (rhomboid major, biceps brachii, flexor pollicis longus, rectus femoris, sternohyoid, trapezius, masseter, digastric muscles) and their nerve-distribution patterns were investigated in four fetal cadavers using the Sihler staining method. The diameter and number of extramuscular (main) and major nerve branches, the number of minor nerve branches, and anastomoses were examined and evaluated statistically. Results: With regards to the number of extramuscular (main) nerve branches, the rhomboid major muscle resembled the flexor pollicis longus, trapezius, masseter, and sternohyoid muscles, and the anterior belly of the digastricus muscle (p > 0.05), whereas it was significantly different from the rectus femoris, the posterior belly of digastricus, and the long and short heads of the biceps brachii (p < 0.05). Trapezius and masseter muscles were different from all of the skeletal muscles that were studied with regards to the diameter of main branches (p < 0.05). The masseter muscle had the largest diameter (p < 0.05). With regards to the number of minor nerve branches, the sternohyoid muscle was significantly different from all the skeletal muscles that were studied (p < 0.05) except the short head of the biceps brachii, rectus femoris, and the posterior belly of digastricus (p > 0.05). As for the number of neural anastomoses, the sternohyoid muscle was statistically different from all skeletal muscles that were studied (p < 0.05) except the masseter and trapezius muscles (p > 0.005). Conclusions: A surgeon's thorough knowledge of the relationship between the shape and nerve distribution pattern of skeletal muscles is important in successful reinnervation and regeneration of these muscles. It might also be useful in the field of muscle transplantation.},

abstract = {The analysis of surface electromyographic (EMG) data recorded from the muscles of the back during isometric constant-force contractions has been a useful tool for assessing muscle deficits in patients with lower back pain (LBP). Until recently, extending the technique to dynamic tasks, such as lifting, has not been possible due to the nonstationarity of the EMG signals. Recent developments in time-frequency analysis procedures to compute the instantaneous median frequency (IMDF) were utilized in this study to overcome these limitations. Healthy control subjects with no history of LBP (n = 9; mean age 26.3 +/- 6.7) were instrumented for acquisition of surface EMG data from six electrodes on the thoraco-lumbar region and whole-body kinematic data from a stereo-photogrammetric system. Data were recorded during a standardized repetitive lifting task (load = 15{\%} body mass; 12 lifts/min; 5-min duration). The task resulted in significant decreases in IMDF for six of the nine subjects, with a symmetrical pattern of fatigue among contralateral muscles and greater decrements in the lower lumbar region. For those subjects with a significant decrease in IMDF, a lower limb and/or upper limb biomechanical adaptation to fatigue was observed during the task. Increases in the peak box acceleration were documented. In two subjects, the acceleration doubled its value from the beginning to the end of the exercise, which lead to a significant increase in the torque at L4/L5. This observation suggests an association between muscle fatigue at the lumbar region and the way the subject manipulates the box during the exercise. Fatigue-related biomechanical adaptations are discussed as a possible supplement to functional capacity assessments among patients with LBP.},

First published April 6, 2006; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.01447.2005. -The antigravity soleus muscle ( Sol) is crucial for compensation of stance perturbation. A corticospinal contribution to the compensatory response of the Sol is under debate. The present study assessed spinal, corticospinal, and cortical excitability at the peaks of short- (SLR), medium- (MLR), and long-latency responses (LLR) after posterior translation of the feet. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation were individually adjusted so that the peaks of either motor evoked potential (MEP) or H reflex coincided with peaks of SLR, MLR, and LLR, respectively. The influence of specific, presumably direct, corticospinal pathways was investigated by H-reflex conditioning. When TMS was triggered so that the MEP arrived in the Sol at the same time as the peaks of SLR and MLR, EMG remained unaffected. Enhanced EMG was observed when the MEP coincided with the LLR peak (P < 0.001). Similarly, conditioning of the H reflex by subthreshold TMS facilitated H reflexes only at LLR (P < 0.001). The earliest facilitation after perturbation occurred after 86 ms. The TMS-induced H-reflex facilitation at LLR suggests that increased cortical excitability contributes to the augmentation of the LLR peaks. This provides evidence that the LLR in the Sol muscle is at least partly transcortical, involving direct corticospinal pathways. Additionally, these results demonstrate that similar to 86 ms after perturbation, postural compensatory responses are cortically mediated.},

The amplitude of the PIC is proportional to the level of neuromodulatory input from the brainstem, which is mediated primarily by the monoamines serotonin and norepinephrine. During normal motor behavior, monoaminergic drive is likely to be moderately strong and the dendritic PIC generates many of the characteristic features of motor unit firing patterns. Most of the PIC activates at or below recruitment threshold and thus motor unit firing patterns exhibit a linear increase just above recruitment. The dendritic PIC allows motor unit derecruitment to occur at a lower input level than recruitment, thus providing sustained tonic firing with little or no synaptic input, especially in low-threshold units. However the dendritic PIC can be readily deactivated by synaptic inhibition. The overall amplification due to the dendritic PIC and other effects of monoamines on motoneurons greatly increases the input-output gain of the motor pool. Thus the brainstem neuromodulatory input provides a mechanism by which the excitability of motoneurons can be varied for different motor behaviors. This control system is lost in spinal cord injury but PICs nonetheless recover near-normal amplitudes in the months following the initial injury. The relationship of these findings to the cause of the spasticity syndrome developing after spinal cord injury is discussed.},

abstract = {Motor control deficits have been suggested as potential cause and/or effect of a-specific chronic low-back pain and its recurrent behavior. Therefore, the goal of this study is to identify motor control in low-back stabilization by simultaneously quantifying the intrinsic and reflexive contributions. Upper body sway was evoked using continuous force perturbations at the trunk, while subjects performed a resist or relax task. Frequency response functions (FRFs) and coherences of the admittance (kinematics) and reflexes (sEMG) were obtained. In comparison with the relax task, the resist task resulted in a 61{\%} decrease in admittance and a 73{\%} increase in reflex gain below 1.1Hz. Intrinsic and reflexive contributions were captured by a physiologically-based, neuromuscular model, including proprioceptive feedback from muscle spindles (position and velocity) and Golgi tendon organs (force). This model described on average 90{\%} of the variance in kinematics and 39{\%} of the variance in sEMG, while resulting parameter values were consistent over subjects.},

@article{Horak2006,
abstract = {Postural control is no longer considered simply a summation of static reflexes but, rather, a complex skill based on the interaction of dynamic sensorimotor processes. The two main functional goals of postural behaviour are postural orientation and postural equilibrium. Postural orientation involves the active alignment of the trunk and head with respect to gravity, support surfaces, the visual surround and internal references. Sensory information from somatosensory, vestibular and visual systems is integrated, and the relative weights placed on each of these inputs are dependent on the goals of the movement task and the environmental context. Postural equilibrium involves the coordination of movement strategies to stabilise the centre of body mass during both self-initiated and externally triggered disturbances of stability. The specific response strategy selected depends not only on the characteristics of the external postural displacement but also on the individual's expectations, goals and prior experience. Anticipatory postural adjustments, prior to voluntary limb movement, serve to maintain postural stability by compensating for destabilising forces associated with moving a limb. The amount of cognitive processing required for postural control depends both on the complexity of the postural task and on the capability of the subject's postural control system. The control of posture involves many different underlying physiological systems that can be affected by pathology or sub-clinical constraints. Damage to any of the underlying systems will result in different, context-specific instabilities. The effective rehabilitation of balance to improve mobility and to prevent falls requires a better understanding of the multiple mechanisms underlying postural control.},

This is due to both the advent of multielectrodes, which has enabled recording of LFPs at tens to hundreds of sites simultaneously, and the insight that LFPs offer a unique window into key integrative synaptic processes in cortical populations. However, owing to its numerous potential neural sources, the LFP is more difficult to interpret than are spikes. Careful mathematical modelling and analysis are needed to take full advantage of the opportunities that this signal offers in understanding signal processing in cortical circuits and, ultimately, the neural basis of perception and cognition.},

abstract = {Balance in the elderly population is a major concern given the often catastrophic and disabling consequences of fall-related injuries. Structural and functional declines of the somatosensory system occur with aging and potentially contribute to postural instability in older adults. The objectives of this article are: (1) to discuss the evidence regarding age-related anatomical and physiological changes that occur in the peripheral proprioceptive and cutaneous systems, (2) to relate the basic science research to the current evidence regarding clinical changes associated with normal aging, and (3) to review the evidence regarding age-related proprioceptive and cutaneous clinical changes and relate it to research examining balance performance in older adults. The article is organized by an examination of the receptors responsible for activating afferent pathways (muscle spindle, golgi tendon organ, and articular and cutaneous receptors) and the corresponding sensory afferent fibers and neurons. It integrates basic science laboratory findings with clinical evidence suggesting that advanced aging results in a decline in cutaneous sensation and proprioception. The potential relationship between postural instability and sensory impairments in older adults also is discussed. Current laboratory and clinical evidence suggests that aging results in: (1) diverse and nonuniform declines in the morphology and physiological function of the various sensory structures examined, (2) preferential loss of distal large myelinated sensory fibers and receptors, and (3) impaired distal lower-extremity proprioception, vibration and discriminative touch, and balance. These findings provide foundational knowledge that emphasizes the importance of using reliable and valid sensory testing protocols for older adults and the need for further research that clarifies the relationship between sensory impairment and balance.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify experimentally in vivo changes in pennation angle, fibre length and muscle thickness in the triceps surae complex in man in response to changes in ankle position and isometric plantarflexion moment and (2) compare changes in the above muscle architectural characteristics occurring in the transition from rest to a given isometric plantarflexion intensity with the estimations of a planimetric muscle model assuming constant thickness and straight muscle fibres. 2. The gastrocnemius medialis (GM), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and soleus (SOL) muscles of six males were scanned with ultrasonography at different sites along and across the muscle belly at rest and during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) trials at ankle angles of -15 deg (dorsiflexed direction), 0 deg (neutral position), +15 deg (plantarflexed direction) and +30 deg. Additional images were taken at 80, 60, 40 and 20 {\%} of MVC at an ankle angle of 0 deg. 3. In all three muscles and all scanned sites, as ankle angle increased from -15 to +30 deg, pennation increased (by 6-12 deg, 39-67{\%}, P < 0.01 at rest and 9-16 deg, 29-43{\%}, P < 0.01 during MVC) and fibre length decreased (by 15-28 mm, 32-34 {\%}, P < 0.01 at rest and 8-10 mm, 27-30{\%}, P < 0.05 during MVC). Thickness in GL and SOL increased during MVC compared with rest (by 5-7 mm, 36-47 {\%}, P < 0.01 in GL and 6-7 mm, 38-47 {\%}, P < 0.01 in SOL) while thickness of GM did Plot differ (P > 0.05) between rest and MVC. 4. At any given ankle angle the model underestimated changes in GL and SOL occurring in the transition from rest to MVC in pennation angle (by 9-12 deg, 24-38 {\%}, P < 0.01. in GL and 9-14 deg, 25-28 {\%}, P < 0.01 in SOL) and fibre length (by 6-15 mm, 22-39 {\%}, P < 0.01 in GL and 6-8 mm, 23-24 {\%}, P < 0.01 in SOL). 5. The findings of the study indicate that tie mechanical output of muscle as estimated by the model used may be unrealistic due to errors in estimating the changes in muscle architecture during contraction compared with rest.},

abstract = {1. The properties of interneurones located in the 4th lumbar segment of the cat spinal cord (L4 interneurones) have been investigated by intracellular and extracellular recording from individual neurones. The study focused on interneurones projecting to hind-limb motor nuclei and/or interposed in pathways from group II muscle afferents. The projection to motor nuclei was assessed from antidromic activation of the neurones by stimuli applied in the motor nuclei of the 7th lumbar (L7) segment. 2. Interneurones which projected to gastrocnemius-soleus or hamstring motor nuclei were found in laminae VI and VII and at the border between laminae VII and VIII. The dominant peripheral input to most of them was from group II muscle afferents, but they were also influenced by group I muscle afferents and by afferents in cutaneous, joint and interosseous nerves. Both excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (i.p.s.p.s) were evoked from all of these fibre systems. 3. The same kind of multimodal input was also found in other interneurones in laminae VI and VII. However, their axonal projections were not identified and they might have included neurones projecting to motor nuclei (though outside the areas which were stimulated) as well as neurones with more local actions. 4. Interneurones located in laminae IV and V of the dorsal horn appeared to constitute a separate functional population since both their projections and their input differed from those of the more ventrally located interneurones; none of the dorsal horn interneurones were found to project to motor nuclei and none had input from group I afferents, although they were influenced by group II muscle afferents and by afferents in cutaneous, joint and interosseous nerves. 5. Many of the excitatory actions from group I and II afferents upon L4 interneurones were found to be evoked monosynaptically. A high proportion of L4 neurones synapsing upon motoneurones would thus be interposed in disynaptic reflex pathways from these afferents. In comparison to actions evoked via interneurones of the caudal lumbar segments, any post-synaptic potentials (p.s.p.s) evoked via L4 interneurones would be delayed. These delays would amount to 0.4-0.9 ms for p.s.p.s. from group I afferents and by 0.5-2.5 ms for group II p.s.p.s. 6. In many interneurones, particularly those located ventrally, i.p.s.p.s. were evoked by group I and II muscle afferents at latencies which indicated that they were evoked disynaptically. They may therefore reflect inhibitory interactions between subpopulations of L4 interneurones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Understanding the origin of noise, or variability, in the motor system is an important step towards understanding how accurate movements are performed. Variability of joint torque during voluntary activation is affected by many factors such as the precision of the descending motor commands, the number of muscles that cross the joint, their size and the number of motor units in each. To investigate the relationship between the peripheral factors and motor noise, the maximum voluntary torque produced at a joint and the coefficient of variation of joint torque were recorded from six adult human subjects for four muscle/joint groups in the arm. It was found that the coefficient of variation of torque decreases systematically as the maximum voluntary torque increases. This decreasing coefficient of variation means that a given torque or force can be more accurately generated by a stronger muscle than a weaker muscle. Simulations demonstrated that muscles with different strengths and different numbers of motor units could account for the experimental data. In the simulations, the magnitude of the coefficient of variation of muscle force depended primarily on the number of motor units innervating the muscle, which relates positively to muscle strength. This result can be generalised to the situation where more than one muscle is available to perform a task, and a muscle activation pattern must be selected. The optimal muscle activation pattern required to generate a target torque using a group of muscles, while minimizing the consequences of signal dependent noise, is derived.},

abstract = {Spike frequency adaptation (SFA) is a fundamental property of repetitive firing in motoneurones (MNs). Early SFA (occurring over several hundred milliseconds) is thought to be important in the initiation of muscular contraction. To date the mechanisms underlying SFA in spinal MNs remain unclear. In the present study, we used both whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of MNs in lumbar spinal cord slices prepared from motor functionally mature mice and computer modelling of spinal MNs to investigate the mechanisms underlying SFA. Pharmacological blocking agents applied during whole-cell recordings in current-clamp mode demonstrated that the medium AHP conductance (apamin), BK-type Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (iberiotoxin), voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (CdCl2), M-current (linopirdine) and persistent Na+ currents (riluzole) are all unnecessary for SFA. Measurements of Na+ channel availability including action potential amplitude, action potential threshold and maximum depolarization rate of the action potential were found to correlate with instantaneous firing frequency suggesting that the availability of fast, inactivating Na+ channels is involved in SFA. Characterization of this Na+ conductance in voltage-clamp mode demonstrated that it undergoes slow inactivation with a time course similar to that of SFA. When experimentally measured parameters for the fast, inactivating Na+ conductance (including slow inactivation) were incorporated into a MN model, SFA could be faithfully reproduced. The removal of slow inactivation from this model was sufficient to remove SFA. These data indicate that slow inactivation of the fast, inactivating Na+ conductance is likely to be the key mechanism underlying early SFA in spinal MNs.},

abstract = {Tendon develops force proportional to the distance it is stretched beyond its slack length. Tendon slack length is an important parameter for musculoskeletal models because it can greatly affect estimations of muscle force. Unfortunately, tendon slack length is a difficult parameter to measure, and therefore values for it are not often reported in the literature. In this paper we present a numerical method for estimating tendon slack length from architectural parameters of the muscle. Specifically, tendon slack length is computed iteratively from musculotendon lengths determined when a corresponding joint is held at two angles, and from knowledge of the muscle's optimal fiber length. Idealized data generated using SIMM were used to test the tendon slack length algorithm. The method converged to within 1{\{}{\%}{\}} of the "true" tendon slack length specified in the SIMM model. The advantage of the method outlined in this paper is that it yields subject-specific estimates of tendon slack length, given subject-specific input parameters.},

@article{Menegaldo2006,
abstract = {This paper shows a new method to estimate the muscle forces in musculoskeletal systems based on the inverse dynamics of a multi-body system associated optimal control. The redundant actuator problem is solved by minimizing a time-integral cost function, augmented with a torque-tracking error function, and muscle dynamics is considered through differential constraints. The method is compared to a previously implemented human posture control problem, solved using a Forward Dynamics Optimal Control approach and to classical static optimization, with two different objective functions. The new method provides very similar muscle force patterns when compared to the forward dynamics solution, but the computational cost is much smaller and the numerical robustness is increased. The results achieved suggest that this method is more accurate for the muscle force predictions when compared to static optimization, and can be used as a numerically 'cheap' alternative to the forward dynamics and optimal control in some applications.

Simple organizing principles are required for us to make sense of this abundance of possibilities and wealth of related data. We suggest that energy minimization subject to functional constraints may be one such unifying principle. We compared the energy needed to produce action potentials singly and in trains for a wide range of channel densities and kinetic parameters and examined which combinations of parameters maximized spiking function while minimizing energetic cost. We confirmed these results for sodium channels using a dynamic current clamp in neocortical fast spiking interneurons. We find further evidence supporting this hypothesis in a wide range of other neurons from several species and conclude that the ion channels in these neurons minimize energy expenditure in their normal range of spiking.},

abstract = {The sensorimotor cortex activity measured by scalp EEG shows coherence with electromyogram (EMG) activity within the 15- to 35-Hz frequency band ($\beta$-band) during weak to moderate intensity of isometric voluntary contraction. This coupling is known to change its frequency band to the 35- to 60-Hz band ($\gamma$-band) during strong contraction. This study aimed to examine whether such contraction level-related modulation of corticomuscular coupling differs between muscles with different muscle compositions and functions. In 11 healthy young adults, we quantified the coherence between EEG over the sensorimotor cortex and rectified EMG during tonic isometric voluntary contraction at 10-70{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction of the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles, respectively. In the TA, the EEG-EMG coherence shifted from the $\beta$-band to the $\gamma$-band with increasing contraction level. Indeed, the magnitude of $\beta$-band EEG-EMG coherence was significantly decreased, whereas that of $\gamma$-band coherence was significantly increased, when the contraction level was above 60{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction. In contrast to the TA, the SOL showed no such frequency changes of EEG-EMG coherence with alterations in the contraction levels. In other words, the maximal peak of EEG-EMG coherence in the SOL existed within the $\beta$-band, irrespective of the contraction levels. These findings suggest that the central nervous system regulates the frequency of corticomuscular coupling to exert the desired levels of muscle force and, notably, that the applicable rhythmicity of the coupling for performing strong contractions differs between muscles, depending on the physiological muscle compositions and functions of the contracting muscle.},

abstract = {This study examined the evolution of H-reflex and V-wave responses of soleus muscle during maximal voluntary plantar-flexor contraction. We also investigated the relationship between the V response and force level and between V-wave during maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and the maximal H reflex at rest. The H-reflex and the V-wave responses are measures of motoneuron excitability and also reflect the magnitude of presynaptic inhibition on Ia afferents and the magnitude of descending motor drive. Both may be influenced by postsynaptic inhibition. Twenty male subjects participated in the study and were assigned to one of two groups. The maximal M wave (Mmax) was evoked at rest in the 20 subjects, who then performed 10 maximal voluntary contraction. During MCV performance, a stimulus was delivered at supra-maximal intensity, which allowed us to record the superimposed M wave (Msup) and V wave of the soleus muscle. These parameters were also recorded during sub-maximal contractions (20, 40, 60, 80{\{}{\%}{\}} of one MVC) in 10 subjects. The maximal H reflex (Hmax), was evoked at rest in the other 10 subjects. These subjects then performed 10 MVC and the Hsup (superimposed H, evoked by means of stimulus at Hmax intensity) was recorded. The results show that the amplitude of maximal M wave increased during MVC (gain 44.52 +/- 10.71{\{}{\%}{\}}). No significant difference between Hmax/Mmax at rest and the Hsup/Msup ratios during MVC was observed, while an effect of force level on the V/Msup ratio was found. V/Msup and Hmax/Mmax were linearly correlated (r2 = 0.81), but V/Msup was significantly lower (P < 0.01) than Hmax/Mmax. In conclusion, the present study shows that maximal voluntary contractions potentiate some reflex responses. The V wave, which reflects motoneuron excitability presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents and the magnitude of descending central motor drive to spinal motoneurons, may be a relatively simple method to analyse the modulation adaptive neural alterations at spinal and supraspinal level during voluntary contractions.},

abstract = {Beta-range oscillatory activity measured over the motor cortex and beta synchrony between cortex and spinal cord can be up- or downregulated in anticipation of a postural challenge or the initiation of movement. Based on these properties of beta activity in the preparation for future events, the present investigation addressed whether simultaneous up- and downregulation of beta activity might act as an online mechanism to suppress and select competing responses. Measures of local and long-range beta synchrony were obtained from electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals recorded during a cued choice reaction task. Analyses focused on task-related changes in beta synchrony during a 2-s delay period between cue and response signal. Analyzed separately, none of the beta measures (spectral power, corticospinal coherence, corticospinal phase synchronization) showed simultaneous up- and downregulation over opposite hemispheres controlling the competing responses. However, the combined pattern of beta measures showed beta power desynchronization associated with selection of a response and increased corticospinal coherence and phase synchronization associated with suppression of a response. These results indicate that concurrent up- and downregulation of different components of beta oscillatory activity is likely to have a functional role in response selection, resembling attentional modulation of alpha activity in visual selection.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to examine changes in the distribution of a stretch to the muscle fascicles with changes in contraction intensity in the human triceps surae and to relate fascicle stretch responses to short-latency stretch reflex behavior. Thirteen healthy subjects were seated in an ankle ergometer, and dorsiflexion stretches (8 degrees; 250 degrees/s) were applied to the triceps surae at different moment levels (0-100{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction). Surface EMG was recorded in the medial gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles, and ultrasound was used to measure medial gastrocnemius and soleus fascicle lengths. At low forces, reflex amplitudes increased despite a lack of change or even a decrease in fascicle stretch velocities. At high forces, lower fascicle stretch velocities coincided with smaller stretch reflexes. The results revealed a decline in fascicle stretch velocity of over 50{\%} between passive conditions and maximal force levels in the major muscles of the triceps surae. This is likely to be an important factor related to the decline in stretch reflex amplitudes at high forces. Because short-latency stretch reflexes contribute to force production and stiffness regulation of human muscle fibers, a reduction in afferent feedback from muscle spindles could decrease the efficacy of human movements involving the triceps surae, particularly where high force production is required.},

It was shown that, as in the case of an infinite fibre, the PS could be represented as the product of power spectra of the input signal (the first temporal derivative of the intracellular action potential, IAP) and of the impulse response (IR) of the fibre of finite length as a system of EP generation. The interrelations between the two multipliers determine the sensitivity of the EP power spectrum to alterations in parameters. The anatomical parameters of the fibre (length, depth, position of the end-plate in respect of the fibre ends) affect the EP power spectrum through IR power spectrum. Variations of the EP characteristic frequencies along the fibre length as well as oscillations in the PS are intrinsic properties of the fibre of finite length. (C) 1998 IPEM.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic usefulness of posturography in 2 well-defined patient groups with impaired balance.

PATIENTS: Ten control subjects, 10 patients with bilateral vestibular loss, and 10 patients with cerebellar atrophy.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Amplitude, velocity, and frequency of sway in the anteroposterior and medial-lateral directions on a static platform, on foam, and on a moving platform.

RESULTS: Both patient groups consistently had increased sway compared with controls, particularly when standing on foam or on a moving platform with eyes closed. Sway amplitude and velocity were increased about the same amount. The Romberg ratio (sway with eyes closed/sway with eyes open) did not reliably differentiate patients from controls or the 2 patient groups from each other. Some patients with cerebellar atrophy exhibited a characteristic body tremor at about 3 Hz in the anteroposterior direction.

CONCLUSIONS: Although sway amplitude and velocity were consistently increased in patients with bilateral vestibular loss and patients with cerebellar atrophy, none of the posturography measurements reliably distinguished the 2 patient groups. The finding of increased frequency of sway in the anteroposterior direction in patients with cerebellar atrophy was of limited value since the tremor was visible at the bedside.},

abstract = {A question that still complicates interpretation of local field potentials (LFPs) is how electrode properties like impedance, size, and shape affect recorded LFPs. In addition, how any such effects should be considered when comparing LFP, electroencephalogram (EEG), or electrocorticogram (ECoG) data has not been clearly described. A generally accepted concrete physical model describes that an electrode records the spatial average of the voltage across its uninsulated tip, yet the effects of this spatial averaging on recorded coherence have never been modeled. Using simulations based on this physical model, we show here that for any effects to occur, a spatial voltage gradient on a scale smaller than an electrode's recording site must exist over the site's surface. When this occurs, larger electrodes on average report higher coherence between locations, with the effect continuously increasing as the voltage profile over the extent of the recording site is increasingly nonuniform. We quantitatively compared published coherence estimates of LFP, ECoG, and EEG data across a range of studies and found a possible modest effect of electrode size in published ECoG data only. We used the model to quantify the expected coherence for any electrode size in relation to any given spatial frequency of a voltage profile. From this and existing estimates of the spread of voltages underlying each of these data types, our simulations quantitatively agree with the published data and importantly suggest that LFP coherence will be independent of recording site size within the range of microelectrodes typically used for extracellular recordings.},

abstract = {The descending motor tracts were activated using a high voltage electrical stimulation technique at four levels: the motor cortex, brainstem (around the pyramidal decussation), and the first and sixth thoracic vertebral levels (T1, T6). Electromyographic activity was recorded from the tibialis anterior or extensor digitorum brevis muscles. Consistent motor action potentials could be evoked in all normal subjects. The conduction velocity of the descending tracts was estimated to be 62 to 79 m/s. The sum of synaptic delay and utilization time at the motoneurons (spinal delay time) was estimated to be 0.5 +/- 0.3 ms indicating a mono- or oligosynaptic connection. In patients with diffusely affected descending tracts, the technique showed slowed conduction along the descending tracts and prolonged spinal delay time which may include the time required for temporal summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials as well as synaptic delay and utilization time. In patients with a localized lesion, localized conduction delay was found at the appropriate segment.},

abstract = {Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) results in characteristic muscle and whole-body responses in humans maintaining standing balance. However, the relationship between these two vestibular-evoked responses remains elusive. This study seeks to determine whether mechanical filtering from conversion of lower-limb muscle activity to body sway, during standing balance, can be used to attenuate sway while maintaining biphasic lower-limb muscle responses using frequency-limited stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS). We hypothesized that SVS deprived of frequencies <2 Hz would evoke biphasic muscle responses with minimal whole-body sway due to mechanical filtering of the higher-frequency muscle responses. Subjects were exposed to five stimulus bandwidths: two meant to induce sway responses (0-1 and 0-2 Hz) and three to dissociate vestibular-evoked muscle responses from whole-body sway (0-25, 1-25, and 2-25 Hz). Two main results emerged: 1) SVS-related sway was attenuated when frequencies <2 Hz were excluded, whereas multiphasic muscle and force responses were retained; and 2) the gain of the estimated transfer functions exhibited successive low-pass filtering of vestibular stimuli during conversion to muscle activity, anteroposterior (AP) moment, and sway. This successive low-pass filtering limited the transfer of signal power to frequencies <20 Hz in muscle activity, <5 Hz in AP moment, and <2 Hz in AP trunk sway. Consequently, the present results show that SVS delivered at frequencies >2 Hz to standing humans do not cause a destabilizing whole-body sway response but are associated with the typical biphasic lower-limb muscle responses.},

@article{Prochazka1997,
abstract = {In this paper we review some theoretical aspects of positive feedback in the control of movement. The focus is mainly on new theories regarding the reflexive role of sensory signals from mammalian tendon organ afferents. In static postures these afferents generally mediate negative force feedback. But in locomotion there is evidence of a switch to positive force feedback action. Positive feedback is often associated with instability and oscillation, neither of which occur in normal locomotion. We address this paradox with the use of analytic models of the neuromuscular control system. It is shown that positive force feedback contributes to load compensation and is surprisingly stable because the length-tension properties of mammalian muscle provide automatic gain control. This mechanism can stabilize control even when positive feedback is very strong. The models also show how positive force feedback is stabilized by concomitant negative displacement feedback and, unexpectedly, by delays in the positive feedback pathway. Other examples of positive feedback in animal motor control systems are discussed, including the beta-fusimotor system, which mediates positive feedback of displacement. In general it is seen that positive feedback reduces the sensitivity of the controlled extremities to perturbations of posture and load. We conclude that positive force feedback can provide stable and effective load compensation that complements the action of negative displacement and velocity feedback.},

abstract = {1. The relevance of motoneurone dynamic sensitivity in compensating for the low-pass filter properties of muscle was assessed by stimulating cat muscle units (MUs) with impulse discharges generated by two current-to-rate converters: (i) a spinal motoneurone, sensitive to both the input intensity and its first derivative, and (ii) a linear current-to-rate converter, i.e. a neurone model with the same static sensitivity as the motoneurone but lacking dynamic sensitivity. 2. Discharges generated by injection of sine-wave currents in three motoneurones of the 'fast' type and in the three related model versions mere applied to the axon of forty-six MUs. The MU isometric tension was modulated at the frequency of the current sine wave (0.5-20 Hz). Phase and gain of the current-to-force transduction were measured. 3. When MUs were driven by the model, the force lagged the current by 90 deg at 1 Hz in slow MUs and at around 5 Hz in fast MUs. Under motoneurone drive, the 90 deg phase lag was attained at frequencies about twice as high. 4. The gain of the transduction (peak-to-peak force modulation/peak-to-peak current modulation) decayed when the modulation frequency was increased. In all but five units, the cut-off frequency, F-co (gain attenuated by -3 dB), was higher when the unit was motoneurone driven (F-co Cell) then when it was model driven (F-co Mod). In both conditions, F-co was inversely correlated with the MU's time-to-peak. The advantage conferred by the motoneurone dynamic sensitivity was expressed by the F-co ratio (F-co Cell/F-co Mod). Across the MU population this ratio ranged from 0.6-2.8, was inversely correlated with the time-to peak, and was directly correlated with the half-tension rate, i.e. the impulse rate at which MUs develop 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of their maximal tetanic force. The largest improvement (F-co ratio > 2.0) was found in units with mechanical features similar to those presumably coupled 'in vivo' to the motoneurones utilized for stimulation. 5. This estimate was confirmed in experiments in which trains of pulses, generated by injection of ramp currents in another motoneurone and the related model, were used to activate eight MUs, selected for being similar to that connected 'in vivo' to the motoneurone. As expected, for any gis en current slope the rising phase of isometric tension was steeper when units were motoneurone driven than when they were model driven. The gain (force slope/current slope) was plotted against the ramp slope to identify the cut-off slope, S-co, at which the gain was attenuated by -3 dB. In this homogeneous MU sample, the ratio expressing the advantage of the motoneurone drive (S-co Cell/S-co Mod, equivalent to the F-co ratio), ranged from 2.62-2.97, values comparable with those observed in sine-wave experiments when the motoneurone and muscle units were properly matched.},

abstract = {We investigated summation of steady excitatory and inhibitory inputs in spinal motoneurons using an in vivo preparation, the decerebrate cat, in which neuromodulatory input from the brain stem facilitated a strong persistent inward current (PIC) in dendritic regions. This dendritic PIC amplified both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents two- to threefold, but within different voltage ranges. Amplification of excitatory synaptic current peaked at voltage-clamp holding potentials near spike threshold (about -55 to -50 mV), whereas amplification of inhibitory current peaked at significantly more depolarized levels (about -45 to -40 mV). Thus the linear sum of excitatory and inhibitory currents tended to vary from net excitatory to net inhibitory as holding potential was depolarized. The actual summed currents, however, diverged from the predicted linear currents. At the peak of excitation, summation averaged about 15{\{}{\%}{\}} sublinear (actual sum was less positive than the linear sum). In contrast, at the peak of inhibition, summation averaged about 18{\{}{\%}{\}} supralinear (actual more positive than linear). Moreover, these nonlinear effects were substantially larger in cells where the variation from peak excitation to peak inhibition for linear summation was larger. When descending neuromodulatory input was eliminated by acute spinalization, PIC amplification was not observed and summation tended to be either sublinear or approximately linear, depending on input source. Overall, in cells with strong PICs, nonlinear summation of excitation and inhibition does occur, but this nonlinearity results in a more consistent relationship between membrane potential and the summed excitatory and inhibitory current.},

abstract = {Objective: Non-invasive transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) induces changes in spinal cord function in humans. Nonetheless, the current density (J) spatial distributions generated by tsDCS are unknown. This work aimed to estimate the J distributions in the spinal cord during tsDCS. Methods: Computational electromagnetics techniques were applied to realistic human models, based on high-resolution MRI of healthy volunteers (a 26-years-old female adult model "Ella"; a 14 years-old male adolescent model "Louis"; an 11 years old female adolescent model "Billie"). Three electrode montages were modeled. In all cases, the anode was always over the spinal process of the tenth thoracic vertebra and the cathode was placed: (A) above the right arm; (B) over the umbilicus; (C) over Cz. The injected current was 3 mA. The electrodes were conductors within rectangular sponges. Results: Despite inter-individual differences, the J tends to be primarily directed longitudinally along the spinal cord and cauda equina with the region of higher amplitude influenced by the reference electrode position; on transversal sections, the J amplitude distributions were quite uniform. Conclusions: Our modeling approach reveals that the J generated by tsDCS reaches the spinal cord, with a current spread also to the muscle on the back and the spinal nerve. Significance: This study is a first step in better understanding the mechanisms underlying tsDCS. © 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Motor units, defined as a motoneuron and all of its associated muscle fibers, are the basic functional units of skeletal muscle. Their activity represents the final output of the central nervous system, and their role in motor control has been widely studied. However, there has been relatively little work focused on the mechanical significance of recruiting variable numbers of motor units during different motor tasks. This review focuses on factors ranging from molecular to macroanatomical components that influence the mechanical output of a motor unit in the context of the whole muscle, These factors range from the mechanical properties of different muscle fiber types to the unique morphology of the muscle fibers constituting a motor unit of a given type and to the arrangement of those motor unit fibers in three dimensions within the muscle. We suggest that as a result of the integration of multiple levels of structural and physiological levels of organization, unique mechanical properties of motor units are likely to emerge.

abstract = {1. Cholinergic terminals in the rat spinal cord were revealed by immunohistochemical detection of the vesicular acetycholine transporter (VAChT). In order to determine the relationships of these terminals to Renshaw cells, we used dual immunolabelling with antibodies against gephyrin or calbindin D28k to provide immunohistochemical identification of Renshaw cells in lamina VII of the ventral horn. 2. A total of 50 Renshaw cells were analysed quantitatively using a computer-aided reconstruction system to provide accurate localization of contact sites and determination of somatic and dendritic surface area. Dendrites could be traced for up to 413 microm from the soma in calbindin D28k-identified Renshaw cells and up to 184 microm in gephyrin-identified cells. 3. A total of 3330 cholinergic terminals were observed on 50 Renshaw cells, with a range of 21-138 terminal appositions per cell (mean 66.6 +/- 25.56 contacts per cell). The vast majority (83.5 {\{}{\%}{\}}) of the terminals were apposed to dendrites rather than the soma. The overall density of cholinergic contacts increased from a little above 1 per 100 microm2 on the soma and initial 25 microm of proximal dendrites to 4-5 per 100 microm2 on the surface of dendritic segments located 50-250 microm from the soma. Single presynaptic fibres frequently formed multiple contacts with the soma and/or dendrites of individual Renshaw cells. 4. VAChT-immunoreactive terminals apposed to Renshaw cells varied in size from 0.6 to 6.9 microm in diameter (mean 2.26 +/- 0.94; n = 986) and were on average smaller than the cholinergic C-terminals apposed to motoneurones, but larger than VAChT-immunoreactive terminals contacting other ventral horn interneurones. 5. The high density and relatively large size of many cholinergic terminals on Renshaw cells presumably correlates with the strong synaptic connection between motoneurones and Renshaw cells. The fact that the majority of contacts are distributed over the dendrites makes the motoneurone axon collateral input susceptible to inhibition by the prominent glycinergic inhibitory synapses located on the soma and proximal dendrites. The relative positions and structural features of the excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory glycinergic synapses may explain why Renshaw cells, although capable of firing at very high frequency following motor axon stimulation, appear to fire at relatively low rates during locomotor activity.},

abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) transiently induces an electrical field in the tissues beneath the area of application, thereby perturbing local cortical activity if applied over the scalp. It can therefore be used to modulate cerebellar function in healthy humans. Even though the role of the cerebellum in eye movement control and adaptation is well known, few experiments have used eye movements to evaluate the effect of TMS over the cerebellum. Single-pulse TMS over the posterior vermis resulted in impaired accuracy of reflexive saccades, acceleration of smooth pursuit, and coordination of saccades and head movements. TMS over the cerebellar hemisphere decreased pursuit gain. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the posterior vermis impaired saccade adaptation in a double-step paradigm. Comparing the effects of TMS on different behavioural paradigms could be useful to test cerebellar control of reflexive and voluntary eye movements, and as a probe of cerebellar plasticity. rTMS appears to be especially interesting since its effects outlast the stimulation period and its behavioural consequences can therefore be measured without interfering with the execution of eye movements or with the experimental procedures.},

abstract = {In spinal motoneurons, activation of dendritically located depolarizing conductances can lead to amplification of synaptic inputs and the production of plateau potentials. Immunohistochemical and computational studies have implicated dendritic Ca(V)1.3 channels in this amplification and suggest that Ca(V)1.3 channels in spinal motoneurons may be organized in clusters in the dendritic tree. Our goal was to provide physiological evidence for the presence of multiple discrete clusters of voltage-gated calcium channels in spinal motoneurons and to explore the spatial arrangement of these clusters in the dendritic tree. We recorded voltage-gated calcium currents from spinal motoneurons in slices of mature mouse spinal cords. We demonstrate that single somatic voltage-clamp steps can elicit multiple inward currents with varying delays to onset, resulting in a current with a "staircase"-like appearance. Recordings from cultured dorsal root ganglion cells at different stages of neurite development provide evidence that these currents arise from the unclamped portions of the dendritic tree. Finally, both voltage- and current-clamp data were used to constrain computer models of a motoneuron. The resultant simulations impose two conditions on the spatial distribution of Ca-V channels in motoneuron dendrites: one of asymmetry relative to the soma and another of spatial separation between clusters of Ca-V channels. We propose that this compartmentalization would provide motoneurons with the ability to process multiple sources of input in parallel and integrate this processed information to produce appropriate trains of action potentials for the intended motor behavior.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the orderly recruitment of motor units by size provides a functional advantage for the performance of movements compared with a random recruitment order. On the other hand, the excitability of a motor neuron depends on its size and this is intrinsically linked to its innervation number. A range of innervation numbers among motor neurons corresponds to a range of sizes and thus to a range of excitabilities ordered by size. Therefore, if the excitation drive is similar among motor neurons, the recruitment by size is inevitably due to the intrinsic properties of motor neurons and may not have arisen to meet functional demands. In this view, we tested the assumption that orderly recruitment is necessarily beneficial by determining if this type of recruitment produces optimal motor output. Using evolutionary algorithms and without any a priori assumptions, the parameters of neuromuscular models were optimized with respect to several criteria for motor performance. Interestingly, the optimized model parameters matched well known neuromuscular properties, but none of the optimization criteria determined a consistent recruitment order by size unless this was imposed by an association between motor neuron size and excitability. Further, when the association between size and excitability was imposed, the resultant model of recruitment did not improve the motor performance with respect to the absence of orderly recruitment. A consistent observation was that optimal solutions for a variety of criteria of motor performance always required a broad range of innervation numbers in the population of motor neurons, skewed towards the small values. These results indicate that orderly recruitment of motor units in itself does not provide substantial functional advantages for motor control. Rather, the reason for its near-universal presence in human movements is that motor functions are optimized by a broad range of innervation numbers.},

abstract = {Muscle architecture is an important aspect of muscle functioning. Hence, geometry and material properties of muscle have great influence on the force-length characteristics of muscle. We compared experimental results for the gastrocnemius medialis muscle (GM) of the rat to model results of simple geometric models such as a planimetric model and three-dimensional versions of this model. The capabilities of such models to adequately calculate muscle geometry and force-length characteristics were investigated. The planimetric model with elastic aponeurosis predicted GM muscle geometry well: maximal differences are 6, 1, 4 and 6{\%} for fiber length, aponeurosis length, fiber angle and aponeurosis angle respectively. A slanted cylinder model with circular fiber cross-section did not predict muscle geometry as well as the planimetric model, whereas the geometry results of a second slanted cylinder model were identical to the planimetric model. It is concluded that the planimetric model is capable of adequately calculating the muscle geometry over the muscle length range studied. However, for modelling of force-length characteristics more complex models are needed, as none of the models yielded results sufficiently close to experimental data. Modelled force-length characteristics showed an overestimation of muscle optimum length by 2 mm with respect to experimental data, and the force at the ascending limb of the length force curve was underestimated. The models presented neglect important aspects such as non-linear geometry of muscle, certain passive material properties and mechanical interactions of fibers. These aspects may be responsible for shortcomings in the modelling. It is argued that, considering the inability to adequately model muscle length-force characteristics for an isolated maximally activated (in situ) muscle, it is to be expected that prediction will fail for muscle properties in conditions of complex movement with many interacting factors. Therefore, modelling goals should be limited to the heuristic domain rather than expect to be able to predict or even approach medical or biological reality. However, the increased understanding about muscular mechanisms obtained from heuristic use of such simple models may very well be used in creating progress in, for example, clinical applications.

abstract = {This paper presents a density-based method to automatically decompose single-channel intramuscular electromyogram (EMG) signals into their component motor unit action potential (MUAP) trains. In contrast to most previous decomposition methods, which require pre-setting and (or) tuning of multiple parameters, the proposed method takes advantage of the data-dependent strategies in the pattern recognition procedures. In this method, outliers (superpositions) are excluded prior to classification and MUAP templates are identified by an adaptive density-based clustering procedure. MUAP trains are then identified by a novel density-based classifier that incorporates MUAP shape and discharge time information. MUAP trains are merged by a fuzzy system that incorporates expert human knowledge. Finally, superimpositions are resolved to fill the gaps in the MUAP trains. The proposed decomposition algorithm has been experimentally tested on signals from low-force (<= 30{\%} maximal) isometric contractions of the vastus medialis obliquus, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris long-head and tibialis anterior muscles. Comparison with expert manual decomposition that had been verified using a rigorous statistical analysis showed that the algorithm identified 80{\%} of the total 229 motor unit trains with an accuracy greater than 90{\%}. The algorithm is robust and accurate, and therefore it is a promising new tool for decomposing single-channel multi-unit signals.},

Changes in firing probability of single motor units in quadriceps (Q), biceps (Bi), semitendinosus (ST), gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and tibialis anterior (TX) were studied after electrical stimuli between 1 and 3 times motor threshold (MT) applied to common peroneal (CP), superficial (SP) and deep (DP) peroneal, Bi and GM nerves in those nerve-muscle combinations without recurrent inhibition. 2. Stimulation of the CP and Bi nerves evoked in almost all of the explored Q motor units a biphasic elicitation with a low-threshold early peak, attributable to non-monosynaptic group, I excitation, and a higher threshold late peak. When the CP nerve was cooled (or the stimulation applied to a distal branch, DP), the increase in latency was greater for the late than for the early peak, indicating that the late excitation is due to stimulation of afferents with a slower conduction velocity than group I fibres, presumably in the group II range. In ST motor units the group II excitation elicited by stimulation of the GM and SP nerves was particularly large and frequent, and the non-monosynaptic group I excitation was often replaced by an inhibition. 3. A late group II-induced excitation from CP to Q motoneurones and front GM and XP to ST motoneurones was also observed when using the H reflex as a test. 4. The electrical threshold and conduction velocity of the largest diameter fibres evoking the group II excitation were estimated to be 2.1 and 0.65 times those of the fastest Ia afferents, respectively In the combinations tested in the present investigation the group II input seemed to be primarily of muscle origin. 5. The potent heteronymous group II excitation of motoneurones of both flexors and extensors of the knee contrasted with the absence of a group II effect from DP to GM and from GM to TA. In none of the combinations explored was there any evidence for group II inhibition of motoneurones. The possible contribution to postural reactions of the potent group II excitation of thigh motoneurones is discussed.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates the validity of a mathematical model that predicts the force generated by rat skeletal muscles during brief subtetanic and tetanic isometric contractions. The model consists of three coupled differential equations (ODE's). The first two equations represent the calcium dynamics and the third equation represents force dynamics. The model parameters were identified from brief trains of regularly spaces pulses [constant-frequency trains (CFT's)] that produce subtetanic muscle responses. Using these parameters, the model was able to predict isometric forces from other stimulation patterns. For the gastrocnemius muscles predictions were made for responses to CFT's with interpulse intervals (IPI's) ranging from 10 to 50 ms and variable-frequency trains (VFT's), where the initial IPI = 10 ms and the remaining IPI's were identical to those used for the CFT's. For the soleus muscles predictions were made for 10-100-ms CFT's. The shape of the predicted responses closely match the experimental data. Comparisons between experimental and modeled force-time integrals, peak forces, and time-to-peak also suggest excellent agreement between the model and the experiment data. Many physiological parameters predicted by the model agree with values obtained independently by others. In conclusion, the model accurately predicts isometric forces generated by rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles produced by brief stimulation trains.},

abstract = {Background: Sensory assessments are included in clinical and research practice in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). However, their characteristics and relevance in relation to motor involvement and function have rarely been studied. Objectives: To investigate the characteristics and correlates of sensory function in CIDP. Methods: We evaluated the sensory clinical and electrophysiological features in 31 clinically-stabilized, prospectively recruited, CIDP patients and analyzed their relation with motor strength and function as well as with electrophysiology. Results: Sensory function primarily affected large fibres and was predominant in the lower limbs. Sensory Sum Scores (SSS) correlated with Medical Research Council (MRC) motor scores, Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scores (ONLS) and presence of positive sensory symptoms, in upper and lower limbs. Rydel-Seiffer vibration scores correlated with MRC and ONLS scores, in the lower limbs only. Correlations of SSS with sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes and summated compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, were present in the lower limbs but not in the upper limbs, whereas such correlations were ascertained in all extremities for Rydel-Seiffer scores. SNAPs correlated with ONLS scores exclusively in the legs. Conclusions: These results show that sensory involvement relates to motor function in CIDP, suggesting that the disease activity affects concurrently motor and sensory fibres in the disorder. The findings of this cross-sectional analysis may otherwise suggest the practical reliability and usefulness of clinical sensory scores, particularly the SSS, in monitoring disease progression and effects of treatment in the disorder. Further longitudinal study is required to confirm this. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. We measured the modulation of the background firing rate of cat spinal motoneurons produced by simulated, repetitive excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to test the accuracy of several proposed motoneuron input-output functions. Rhythmic discharge was elicited in the motoneurons by injecting suprathreshold current steps 1-1.5 a in duration. On alternate trials, trains of short (0.5-5 ms) current pulses were superimposed on the current steps to simulate the effects of trains of individual EPSPs. The increase in firing rate (Delta F) due to the addition of the pulses was calculated as the difference in motoneuron discharge rate between trials with and without the superimposed pulse trains. 2. In the same motoneurons, we were able to study the effects of changes in pulse frequency, duration, and amplitude, as well as changes in the background discharge rate. A sublinear relationship between pulse rate and Delta F was observed, with Delta F rising relatively steeply with increasing pulse frequency at low pulse rates and saturating at high pulse rates. A similarly shaped relation was observed between Delta F and pulse duration. In contrast, Delta F generally increased in a greater than linear fashion with increasing pulse amplitude. 3. In previous studies we demonstrated that when a relatively constant synaptic input is produced by high-frequency synaptic activity, Delta F is approximately equal to the product of the net synaptic current reaching the soma and the slope of the motoneuron's steady-state frequency-current (f-1) relation. In the present study, this input-output function consistently underestimated the observed Delta F, particularly for low input rates, indicating that the transient current pulses are more effective in modulating motoneuron discharge than an equivalent amount of constant current. 4. Other investigators have proposed input-output functions derived from the relation between synaptic potential amplitude and the magnitude of the peak of a cross correlogram compiled from the discharge of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. These functions consistently overestimated the observed Delta F, particularly for high pulse rates. This overestimation may result in part from the fact that the effects of a synaptic potential (or current pulse) on postsynaptic discharge probability also include a period of decreased firing probability. Moreover, the cross correlation function may depend on the arrival rate of synaptic potentials (or current pulses). 5. Another proposed input-output function based on a simple threshold-crossing model of the motoneuron with a fixed spike threshold predicts firing rates that were often close to the observed Delta F. However, the model did not reproduce the observed relations between Delta F and input pulse rate or pulse duration. 6. The deficiencies of the basic threshold-crossing model may arise from the fact that it does not incorporate variations in membrane conductance and firing threshold that occur in real motoneurons. A more complete motoneuron model that incorporates both of these features was able to replicate the observed Delta Fs associated with changes in input pulse frequency and duration.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of both muscle length and moment arm (MA) on the electromyographic (EMG) and force output of the triceps surae (TS) muscle. Relevance: It is well recognized that changes in muscle length affect both the muscle's force generating capacity as well as its twitch speed. This relationship is well established in animal preparations. Contrary to animal experiments where length can be directly manipulated in isolated muscles, human experiments require that all muscle length changes be secondary to changes in a joint angle. Such experimental manipulations therefore produce changes in not only muscle length, but also in the muscle's MA. The relative effect of muscle length and MA changes on muscle EMG has not been determined in previous experiments. Method: This study was executed in two phases. First, using fresh human cadaver lower limbs, data were gathered describing the relationship between knee and ankle angle changes for maintenance of a constant TS muscle length, while its MA at the ankle joint has been changed. In the second phase of the study, results obtained from phase one were applied to 10 healthy adult human subjects to measure the EMG (surface and fine wire) activity of TS at three different conditions: when both length and MA were shortened, when muscle length was decreased given a constant MA and when MA was shortened given a constant muscle length. Results: A significant increase in muscle activity was found as both the length and MA of TS muscle were shortened. A similar pattern of increased muscle activity was observed when the MA was shortened given a constant muscle length. No significant change in TS activity was found when muscle length was shortened, given a constant MA at the ankle joint. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that changes in the Achilles tendon MA predominate over the muscle length variations in determining the level of TS activity when generating plantar flexion torque.

abstract = {The Poisson process is an often employed model for the activity of neuronal populations. It is known, though, that superpositions of realistic, non- Poisson spike trains are not in general Poisson processes, not even for large numbers of superimposed processes. Here we construct superimposed spike trains from intracellular in vivo recordings from rat neocortex neurons and compare their statistics to specific point process models. The constructed superimposed spike trains reveal strong deviations from the Poisson model. We find that superpositions of model spike trains that take the effective refractoriness of the neurons into account yield a much better description. A minimal model of this kind is the Poisson process with dead-time (PPD). For this process, and for superpositions thereof, we obtain analytical expressions for some second-order statistical quantities-like the count variability, inter-spike interval (ISI) variability and ISI correlations-and demonstrate the match with the in vivo data. We conclude that effective refractoriness is the key property that shapes the statistical properties of the superposition spike trains. We present new, efficient algorithms to generate superpositions of PPDs and of gamma processes that can be used to provide more realistic background input in simulations of networks of spiking neurons. Using these generators, we show in simulations that neurons which receive superimposed spike trains as input are highly sensitive for the statistical effects induced by neuronal refractoriness.},

abstract = {This study proposes a model that combines a realistically scaled neural network made up of pools of spiking neurons, with a musculoskeletal model of the human arm. We used evidence from literature to design topological pools of spinal neurons and their synaptic connections. The spiking output of the motor neuron pools were used as the command signals that generated motor unit forces, and drove joint motion. Feedback information from muscle spindles was relayed to the neural network via monosynaptic and disynaptic pathways. Participant-specific parameters of the combined neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) system were then identified from recorded experimental data. The identified NMS model was used to simulate the arm stretch reflex and the results were validated by comparison to an independent recorded dataset. The models and methodology proposed in this study show that large and complex neural systems can be identified in conjunction with the musculoskeletal systems that they control. This additional layer of detail in NMS models has important relevance to the research communities related to rehabilitation robotics and human movement analysis.},

@article{Schweigart2008,
abstract = {Systems theory analyses have suggested that human upright stance can be modelled in terms of continuous multi-sensory feedback control. So far, these analyses have considered mainly steady-state responses to periodic stimuli and relied on a simplifying model of the body's mechanics in the form of an inverted pendulum. Therefore, they may have ignored relevant aspects of the postural behaviour. To prove a more general validity of a stance control model that we previously derived from such analyses, we now presented subjects with static-dynamic stimulus combinations and assessed response transients, anterior-posterior (a-p) response asymmetries, and possible deviations from the 'inverted pendulum' simplification (by measuring hip and knee bending). We presented normal subjects (Ns) and vestibular loss patients (Ps) with a-p support surface tilt on a motion platform under the instruction to maintain, with eyes closed, the body upright in space. In addition, subjects were to indicate perceived platform tilt with the help of pointers. We combined a fixed-amplitude sinusoidal tilt (0.1 Hz) with static tilts that were varied in amplitude and direction. We recorded upper body (shoulder) and lower body (hip) excursions in space and centre of pressure (COP) shift, and calculated the centre of mass (COM) angular excursion. We found that: (1) Immediately prior to stimulus onset (which was highly predictable), subjects showed a small anticipatory forward lean. (2) The subsequent transient response consisted of two parts. First, the body was moved along with the platform tilt and then, in the second part, the body excursion was braked by starting tilt compensation. Upon increasing tilt amplitude, the braking point showed a pronounced saturation with for-aft asymmetry. (3) During the following prolonged tilt, the tonic body excursions saturated with increasing static tilt amplitude. This saturation also showed a for-aft asymmetry (backwards saturation more pronounced). In contrast, the dynamic body excursions did not depend on the static tilt stimulus. (4) Tilt compensation occurred mainly in the ankle joints, but also involved small synergistic bendings in hips and knees in fixed register to the ankle rotation. (5) After the end of the stimulus, the body returned towards primary position, followed by a pronounced and slowly decaying tonic overshoot which was mainly related to tilt amplitude and initial tonic body excursion. (6) The responses of Ps qualitatively resembled those of Ns, apart from larger body excursions, less pronounced saturations, and less for-aft asymmetries. (7) Perceived platform tilt of Ns and Ps was correlated with their postural tilt compensations, but unlike the postural responses the perceptual responses overestimated actual static and dynamic tilt by a factor of 3-4. Our findings suggest two, so far undescribed and highly nonlinear mechanisms in human stance control. (a) The braking during the transient response appears to reflect a 'sensory reweighting switch' by which subjects change from a control that is referenced to the support to one that is referenced to space. (b) The saturation of the tonic body excursion also reflects a sensory reweighting mechanism; by this, subjects keep their balancing within a certain excursion limit. The two mechanisms were originally not predicted by our stance control model, but do not invalidate it, because they can simply be added to it. Also the observed for-aft asymmetries can be accounted for (by making thresholds in the two mechanisms asymmetric). In its extended form, the model mimics the previous and the new findings. We also conclude that the 'inverted pendulum' simplification is a legitimate simplification. We demonstrate the utility of the model by implementing it into a humanoid robot that then mimics closely the human experimental data. Finally, we present a hypothetical concept on sensory reweighting mechanisms in human stance control, which is meant to serve as a framework for future research.},

abstract = {Theoretical and experimental evidence is presented for the presence in nervous tissue of neurons whose firing rate faithfully follow their input stimulus. Such neurons are shown to deliver their spikes with minimum dissipation per spike. This optimal performance is likely accomplished by use of local circuitry that adjusts conductances to match input currents so that the neuron operates near the threshold for firing. This results in an unusual mechanism for neuronal firing that uses background noise to achieve the desired firing rate. This framework takes place dynamically, and the present deliberations apply under time varying conditions. It is shown that an analytically explicit probability distribution function, which depends on one dimensionless parameter, can account for the interspike interval statistics under general time varying conditions. An innovative analysis based on the unsteady firing rate fits data to the appropriate probability distribution function.},

abstract = {Vestibular pathways form short-latency disynaptic connections with neck motoneurons, whereas they form longer-latency disynaptic and polysynaptic connections with lower limb motoneurons. We quantified frequency responses of vestibular reflexes in neck, back, and lower limb muscles to explain between-muscle differences. Two hypotheses were evaluated: 1) that muscle-specific motor-unit properties influence the bandwidth of vestibular reflexes; and 2) that frequency responses of vestibular reflexes differ between neck, back, and lower limb muscles because of neural filtering. Subjects were exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli over bandwidths of 0-25 and 0-75 Hz while recording activity in sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, erector spinae, soleus, and medial gastrocnemius muscles. Coherence between stimulus and muscle activity revealed markedly larger vestibular reflex bandwidths in neck muscles (0-70 Hz) than back (0-15 Hz) or lower limb muscles (0-20 Hz). In addition, vestibular reflexes in back and lower limb muscles undergo low-pass filtering compared with neck-muscle responses, which span a broader dynamic range. These results suggest that the wider bandwidth of head-neck biomechanics requires a vestibular influence on neck-muscle activation across a larger dynamic range than lower limb muscles. A computational model of vestibular afferents and a motoneuron pool indicates that motor-unit properties are not primary contributors to the bandwidth filtering of vestibular reflexes in different muscles. Instead, our experimental findings suggest that pathway-dependent neural filtering, not captured in our model, contributes to these muscle-specific responses. Furthermore, gain-phase discontinuities in the neck-muscle vestibular reflexes provide evidence of destructive interaction between different reflex components, likely via indirect vestibular-motor pathways.},

abstract = {The vestibular organs can feed perceptual processes that build a picture of our route as we move about in the world. However, raw vestibular signals do not define the path taken because, during travel, the head can undergo accelerations unrelated to the route and also be orientated in any direction to vary the signal. This study investigated the computational process by which the brain transforms raw vestibular signals for the purpose of route reconstruction. We electrically stimulated the vestibular nerves of human subjects to evoke a virtual head rotation fixed in skull co-ordinates and measure its perceptual effect. The virtual head rotation caused subjects to perceive an illusory whole-body rotation that was a cyclic function of head-pitch angle. They perceived whole-body yaw rotation in one direction with the head pitched forwards, the opposite direction with the head pitched backwards, and no rotation with the head in an intermediate position. A model based on vector operations and the anatomy and firing properties of semicircular canals precisely predicted these perceptions. In effect, a neural process computes the vector dot product between the craniocentric vestibular vector of head rotation and the gravitational unit vector. This computation yields the signal of body rotation in the horizontal plane that feeds our perception of the route travelled.},

abstract = {In the present study, the in vivo force-length relations of the human soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were estimated. Measurements were taken in six men at ankle angles from 30 degrees of dorsiflexion to 45 degrees of plantarflexion in steps of 15 degrees, and involved dynamometry, electrical stimulation, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For each muscle and ankle angle studied the following three measurements were carried out: (1) dynamometry-based measurement of maximal voltage tetanic moment, (2) ultrasound-based measurement of pennation angle and fibre length and (3) MRI-based measurement of tendon moment arm length. Tendon forces were calculated dividing moments by moment arm lengths, and muscle forces were calculated dividing tendon forces by the cosine of pennation angles. In the transition from 30 degrees of dorsiflexion to 45 degrees of plantarflexion the SOL muscle fibre length decreased from 3.8 to 2.4 cm and its force decreased from 3330 to 290 N. Over the same range of ankle angles the TA muscle fibre length increased from 3.7 to 6 cm and its force increased from 157 to 644 N. Over the longest muscle fibre lengths reached the force of both muscles remained approximately constant. These results indicate that the intact human SOL and TA muscles operate in the ascending limb and plateau region of the force-length relationship. Similar conclusions were reached when calculating the theoretical operating range of the two muscle sarcomeres in the study.},

abstract = {The biophysical properties of cat motoneuron (MN) models with passive dendrite and different sizes have been extensively tested. However, the behavior of these models in relation to accommodation has not been tested yet. The experimental data reported have shown that MNs accommodate to a very limited degree, exhibiting, in some extension, breakdown of accommodation phenomenon. One possible explanation for the latter behavior would be the presence of persistent sodium conductance. The accommodation can be evaluated by observing threshold latency (TL) curve and the accommodation coefficient (I/I-o)(s), obtained from the response to linearly rising currents. The simulation results have showed that the models exhibit breakdown of accommodation phenomenon and much similar accommodation coefficients, despite their type: 1.463, 1.456 and 1.418 to S, FIR and FF MN models, respectively. According to these data, all the MN models can be classified as slowly accommodating. Our data suggests that accommodation coefficients cannot be associated to the size or to the type of the MN, and persistent sodium conductance might not be necessary to explain breakdown of accommodation phenomenon in MN soma at all.

abstract = {In developing mammalian muscle, axon branches of several motor neurons co-innervate the same muscle fibre. Competition among them results in the strengthening of one and the withdrawal of the rest(1,2). It is not known why one particular axon branch survives or why some competitions resolve sooner than others(3). Here we show that the fate of axonal branches is strictly related to the identity of the axons with which they compete. When two neurons co-innervate multiple target cells, the losing axon branches in each contest belong to the same neuron and are at nearly the same stage of withdrawal. The axonal arbor of one neuron engages in multiple sets of competitions simultaneously. Each set proceeds at a different rate and heads towards a common outcome based on the identity of the competitor. Competitive vigour at each of these sets of local competitions depends on a globally distributed resource: neurons with larger arborizations are at a competitive disadvantage when confronting neurons with smaller arborizations. An accompanying paper tests the idea that the amount of neurotransmitter released is this global resource(4).},

abstract = {Background: The distribution of muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) estimated from surface myoelectric signals differs depending on the recording electrode locations. It is assumed in this study that the irregular values of MFCV may be estimated around the end-plate zone and the fiber endings due to effect of unique interference property of myoelectric signals, and its hypothesis is confirmed experimentally and numerically in consideration of the waveform characteristics of surface myoelectric signals. Material/Methods: In experimental study, the surface myoelectric signals are recorded by array electrodes during voluntary isometric contraction in biceps brachii muscle. In the numerical study, the surface myoelectric signals in consideration of the interference property of some motor unit activities are calculated from the current dipole model which simulated the firing features of muscle fiber from end-plate zone to fiber endings. MFCV is estimated by the technique of cross-correlation. Maximum correlation coefficient (R-xy (T-s)) and amplitude ratio (AAMP(ratio)) are used to evaluate similarity and attenuation rate between traveling signals. Results: In both results of experimental and numerical studies, the MFCV significantly increase when both R-xy (T-s) and AMP(ratio) decrease around the end-plate zone and fiber endings although three parameters denote constant values in the locations other than the end-plate zone and the fiber endings. The high correlativity is recognized between the experimental and numerical data for MFCV, R-xy(T-s), and AMP(ratio). Conclusions: Therefore, it is demonstrated by experimental and theoretical studies that MFCV, R-xy(T-s), and AMP(ratio) are influenced by irregular waveform properties dependent on both positions of the end-plate and fiber endings.},

abstract = {Interspike interval (ISI) distributions of cortical neurons exhibit a range of different shapes. Wide ISI distributions are believed to stem from a balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs that leads to a strongly fluctuating total drive. An important question is whether the full range of experimentally observed ISI distributions can be reproduced by modulating this balance. To address this issue, we investigate the shape of the ISI distributions of spiking neuron models receiving fluctuating inputs. Using analytical tools to describe the ISI distribution of a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron, we identify three key features: 1) the ISI distribution displays an exponential decay at long ISIs independently of the strength of the fluctuating input; 2) as the amplitude of the input fluctuations is increased, the ISI distribution evolves progressively between three types, a narrow distribution (suprathreshold input), an exponential with an effective refractory period (subthreshold but suprareset input), and a bursting exponential (subreset input); 3) the shape of the ISI distribution is approximately independent of the mean ISI and determined only by the coefficient of variation. Numerical simulations show that these features are not specific to the LIF model but are also present in the ISI distributions of the exponential integrate-and-fire model and a Hodgkin-Huxley-like model. Moreover, we observe that for a fixed mean and coefficient of variation of ISIs, the full ISI distributions of the three models are nearly identical. We conclude that the ISI distributions of spiking neurons in the presence of fluctuating inputs are well described by gamma distributions.},

abstract = {The delay of the sensory-motor feedback loop is a destabilizing factor within the neural control mechanism of quiet standing. The purposes of this study were 1) to experimentally identify the neuromusculoskeletal torque-generation process during standing posture and 2) to investigate the effect of the delay induced by this system on the control mechanism of balance during quiet standing. Ten healthy adults participated in this study. The ankle torque, ankle angle, and electromyograms from the right lower leg muscles were measured. A ground-fixed support device was used to support the subject at his/her knees, without changing the natural ankle angle during quiet standing. Each subject was asked to mimic the ankle torque fluctuation by exerting voluntary ankle extension while keeping the supported standing posture. Using the rectified soleus electromyogram as the input and the ankle torque as the output, a critically damped, second-order system (twitch contraction time of 0.152 +/- 0.027 s) successfully described the dynamics of the torque-generation process. According to the performed Bode analysis, the phase delay induced by this torque-generation process in the frequency region of spontaneous body sway during quiet standing was considerably large, corresponding to an effective time delay of about 200 to 380 ms. We compared the stability of the balance control system with and without the torque-generation process and demonstrated that a much smaller number of gain combinations can stabilize the model with the torque-generation process than without it. We concluded that the phase delay induced by the torque-generation process is a more destabilizing factor in the control mechanism of quiet standing than previously assumed, which restricts the control strategies that can stabilize the entire system.},

@article{Holobar2009,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We systematically tested the capability of the Convolution Kernel Compensation (CKC) method to identify motor unit (MU) discharge patterns from the simulated and experimental surface electromyogram (sEMG) during low-force contractions.

METHODS: sEMG was detected with a grid of 13 x 5 electrodes. In simulated signals with 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio, 11+/-3 out of 63 concurrently active MUs were identified with sensitivity >95{\%} in the estimation of their discharge times. In experimental signals recorded at 0-10{\%} of the maximal force, the discharge patterns of (range) 11-19 MUs (abductor pollicis; n=8 subjects), 9-17 MUs (biceps brachii; n=2), 7-11 MUs (upper trapezius; n=2), and 6-10 MUs (vastus lateralis; n=2) were identified. In the abductor digiti minimi muscle of one subject, the decomposition results from concurrently recorded sEMG and intramuscular EMG (iEMG) were compared; the two approaches agreed on 98+/-1{\%} of MU discharges.

CONCLUSION: It is possible to identify the discharge patterns of several MUs during low-force contractions from high-density sEMG.

SIGNIFICANCE: sEMG can be used for the analysis of individual MUs when the application of needles is not desirable or in combination with iEMG to increase the number of sampled MUs.},

abstract = {This paper describes an interactive computer program for decomposing EMG signals into their component motor-unit potential (MUP) trains and for averaging MUP waveforms. The program is able to handle single- or multi-channel signals recorded by needle or fine-wire electrodes during low and moderate levels of muscular contraction. It includes advanced algorithms for template matching, resolving superimpositions, and waveform averaging, as well as a convenient user interface for manually editing and verifying the results. The program also provides the ability to inspect the discharges of individual motor units more closely by subtracting out interfering activity from other MUP trains. Decomposition accuracy was assessed by cross-checking pairs of signals recorded by nearby electrodes during the same contraction. The results show that 100{\%} accuracy can be achieved for MUPs with peak-to-peak amplitudes greater than 2.5 times the rms signal amplitude. Examples are presented to show how decomposition can be used to investigate motor-unit recruitment and discharge behavior, to study motor-unit architecture, and to detect action potential blocking in doubly innervated muscle fibers.

abstract = {A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns the relation between the spiking of individual neurons and the aggregate electrical activity of neuronal ensembles as seen in local field potentials (LFPs). Because LFPs reflect both spiking activity and subthreshold events, this question is not simply one of data aggregation. Recording from 20 neurosurgical patients, we directly examined the relation between LFPs and neuronal spiking. Examining 2030 neurons in widespread brain regions, we found that firing rates were positively correlated with broadband (2-150 Hz) shifts in the LFP power spectrum. In contrast, narrowband oscillations correlated both positively and negatively with firing rates at different recording sites. Broadband power shifts were a more reliable predictor of neuronal spiking than narrowband power shifts. These findings suggest that broadband LFP power provides valuable information concerning neuronal activity beyond that contained in narrowband oscillations.},

abstract = {Movements of the whole-body center of mass during quiet standing have been estimated from measurements of body segment movements. These whole-body center of mass movements have been compared with movements of the center of mass as predicted from a simple inverted-pendulum model of standing. However, the total body center of mass is a weighted average of the center of mass of all individual body segments. The question arises as to how well the total body center of mass represents the individual segments and lower limb joint angles. This study focuses on the validity of how well the individual segments and lower limb angles temporally and spatially synchronize with the total body center of mass. Eleven healthy university students volunteered to participate. Kinematic data were collected using a 3D optoelectronic camera system; kinetic data were collected using a 3D force plate. Participants stood quietly, with eyes open, for 120s. Segment and whole body centers of mass were calculated from a 14 segment, 3D bilateral model. Segment and joint angles were calculated for the lower limbs, bilaterally, and the trunk. Segment center of mass root-mean-square displacements were strongly correlated with center of mass height relative to the ankle joint and were synchronized, or temporally locked, to the movement of the whole body center of mass. Sagittal plane ankle angular displacements were highly correlated to sagittal plane center of mass movement; stronger correlations between body center of mass and lower limb angular displacement were observed, the result of compensatory knee joint angular displacements. These data support and extend the use of an inverted pendulum model to represent quiet standing postural control. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose: Although closed (CKCE) and open (OKCE) kinetic chain exercises are used in athletic training and clinical environments, few studies have compared knee joint biomechanics while these exercises are performed dynamically. The purpose of this study was to quantify knee forces and muscle activity in CKCE (squat and leg press) and OKCE (knee extension). Methods: Ten male subjects performed three repetitions of each exercise at their 12-repetition maximum. Kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic data were calculated using video cameras (60 Hz), force transducers (960 Hz), and EMG (960 Hz). Mathematical muscle modeling and optimization techniques were employed to estimate internal muscle forces. Results: Overall, the squat generated approximately twice as much hamstring activity as the leg press and knee extensions. Quadriceps muscle activity was greatest in CKCE when the knee was near full fluxion and in OKCE when the knee was near full extension. OKCE produced more rectus femoris activity while CKCE produced more vasti muscle activity. Tibiofemoral compressive force was greatest in CKCE near full flexion and in OKCE near full extension. Peak tension in the posterior cruciate ligament was approximately twice as great in CKCE, and increased with knee flexion. Tension in the anterior cruciate ligament was present only in OKCE, and occurred near full extension. Patellofemoral compressive force was greatest in CKCE near full flexion and in the mid-range of the knee extending phase in OKCE. Conclusion: An understanding of these results can help in choosing appropriate exercises for rehabilitation and training.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the possibility of non-uniform stress within the achilles tendon due to individual force contributions of the triceps surae. DESIGN: Calculation of non-uniform stress through discrepancies in moments about the ankle joint. BACKGROUND: Non-uniform stress over the cross-sectional area have been implied in the etiology of achilles tendon injury and may influence functional aspects. However, this has not been empirically demonstrated. METHODS: In vivo achilles tendon forces were measured with an optic fibre technique during isometric plantarflexions at systematically varied knee angles and contraction intensities. A comparison to the plantar force measured underneath the metatarsal heads permitted the calculation of the achilles tendon contribution to the resultant plantarflexion moment. The achilles tendon force was further differentiated into gastrocnemius and soleus contributions. Individual muscle activation patterns were described. RESULTS: The average achilles tendon contribution to the resultant moment was 67.4{\%}. Variations were found at different knee angles and contraction intensities. A force discrepancy of 967 N occurred between gastrocnemius and soleus over a gastrocnemius length change of 2.67 cm. This corresponded to a stress discrepancy of 21 N/mm(2) over the tendon cross-sectional area. Separate muscles showed individual activation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Non-uniform stress in the achilles tendon can occur through modifications of individual muscle contributions. RELEVANCE: Non-uniform stress in the achilles tendon has been implied in its injury etiology. This study demonstrated such loading resulting from discrepancies in individual muscle forces.},

abstract = {The origin of variability in goal-directed movements is not well understood. Variability can originate from several neural processes such as target localization, movement planning, and movement execution. Here we examine variability resulting from noise in movement execution. In several experiments, subjects moved their unseen hand to visual targets, under conditions which were designed to minimize the variability expected from localization and planning processes. We tested short movements in 32 directions in a center-out reaching task. The variability in the movement endpoints and in the initial movement direction varied systematically with the movement direction, with some directions having up to twice the variability of others. In a second experiment we tested four movements in the same direction but with different extents. Here, the longer movements were systematically curved, and the endpoint ellipses were not aligned with the straight line between starting and end position, but they were roughly aligned with the last part of the trajectory. We show that the variability observed in these experiments cannot be explained by planning noise but is well explained by noise in movement execution. A combination of both signal-dependent and signal-independent noise in the amplitude of the motor commands and temporal noise in their duration can explain the observed variability. Our results suggest that, in general, execution noise accounts for at least a large proportion of movement variability.},

abstract = {Due to the non-stationary, multicomponent nature of biomedical signals. the use of time-frequency analysis can be inevitable for these signals. The choice of the proper time-frequency distribution (TFD) that can reveal the exact multicomponent Structure of biological signals is vital in many applications. including the diagnosis of medical abnormalities. In this paper, the instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation using four well-known TFDs is applied for analyzing biological signals. These TFDs are: the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD). the Exponential T-distribution (ETD) and the Hyperbolic T-distribution (HTD). Their performance over normal and abnormal biological signals as well as over multicomponent frequency modulation (FM) signals in additive Gaussian noise was compared. Moreover, the feasibility of utilizing the wavelet transform (WT) in IF estimation is also Studied. The biological signals considered in this work arc the surface electromyogram (SEMG) with the presence of ECG noise and abnormal cardiac signals. The abnormal cardiac signals were taken from a patient with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. and a patient with supraventricular arrhythmia. Simulation results showed that the HTD has a superior performance. in terms of resolution and cross-terms reduction, as compared to other time-frequency distributions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery time constant (an index of muscle aerobic capacity) and contractile ATP cost were estimated from a gated (31)P NMR protocol which does not require intense, repetitive exercise. Subjects performed 2-s duration, maximum voluntary isometric ankle dorsiflexion contractions at 30-s intervals for 8 min (total 15 contractions), while single-shot (31)P spectra (51.7 MHz, TR 3 s) were acquired from the anterior compartment muscle. Spectra from the sixth through 15th contractions were retrospectively sorted, yielding 10 spectra (each 10 averages) gated to times before and after contraction. There was no significant decrease in muscle pH, allowing the calculation of contractile ATP cost directly from the percentage change in PCr during contraction cycles [8.86 +/- 0.82{\{}{\%}{\}} (SE, n = 11) of PCr at rest], corresponding to an ATP cost of 1.69 +/- 0.16 mM/s (range 0.99-2.49 mM/s), assuming an 8.2 mM ATP concentration. The time constant for PCr recovery (tau 41.8 +/- 4.2 s, range 22.0-60.8 s) was calculated from tau = -Deltat/ln[D/(D + Q)], where Q is the percentage change in PCr due to contraction, D is the additional steady-state percentage drop in PCr from rest and Deltat is the interval between contractions. In the same subjects, the monoexponential PCr recovery time constant after more intense, repetitive isometric ankle dorsiflexion exercise (30 s at 0.5 Hz, 50{\{}{\%}{\}} duty cycle) was similar to (36.2 +/- 3.5 s, range 16.5-58.8 s) and well correlated with (r = 0.82) the gated result. In contrast to the gated protocol, muscle pH decreased from 7.01 +/- 0.01 to 6.78 +/- 0.04 during recovery after the repetitive protocol. Hence the gated protocol allows the estimation of muscle ATP cost and PCr recovery without intense exercise or muscle acidification.},

abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces use neuronal activity recorded from the brain to establish direct communication with external actuators, such as prosthetic arms. It is hoped that brain-machine interfaces can be used to restore the normal sensorimotor functions of the limbs, but so far they have lacked tactile sensation. Here we report the operation of a brain-machine-brain interface (BMBI) that both controls the exploratory reaching movements of an actuator and allows signalling of artificial tactile feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex. Monkeys performed an active exploration task in which an actuator (a computer cursor or a virtual-reality arm) was moved using a BMBI that derived motor commands from neuronal ensemble activity recorded in the primary motor cortex. ICMS feedback occurred whenever the actuator touched virtual objects. Temporal patterns of ICMS encoded the artificial tactile properties of each object. Neuronal recordings and ICMS epochs were temporally multiplexed to avoid interference. Two monkeys operated this BMBI to search for and distinguish one of three visually identical objects, using the virtual-reality arm to identify the unique artificial texture associated with each. These results suggest that clinical motor neuroprostheses might benefit from the addition of ICMS feedback to generate artificial somatic perceptions associated with mechanical, robotic or even virtual prostheses.},

abstract = {A simple surface electromyography (EMG) activation detection algorithm was developed for improved numerical definition of initiation and deactivation of muscle activity during periodic motion when maximum voluntary contractions are impractical to obtain. For the encapsulation of activation/deactivation periods of a signal as percentages of normal cycle parameters, two interrelated and variable thresholds of percent amplitude and duration of a normalized cycle were the analyzed inputs into an algorithm. Outputs for statistical analysis were total percent activation per cycle, standard deviation of activity per cycle, and temporal indices of where the signal turned on and off. Percent activity per cycle had a coefficient of variance of 0.24 (0.11). After the user chose whether to consider the signal for either encompassing all non-base-line activity or peak activity only, resulting coefficients of variation for percent activity were reduced to 0.16 (0.08). The results indicated the feasibility of a mathematically simple algorithm for repeatable decomposition of EMG activity. The need for a modifiable threshold parameter to incorporate varying needs of salient activity levels was also substantiated. (C) 2002 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {In multiple sclerosis, a common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, immune-mediated axon damage is responsible for permanent neurological deficits. How axon damage is initiated is not known. Here we use in vivo imaging to identify a previously undescribed variant of axon damage in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. This process, termed 'focal axonal degeneration' (FAD), is characterized by sequential stages, beginning with focal swellings and progressing to axon fragmentation. Notably, most swollen axons persist unchanged for several days, and some recover spontaneously. Early stages of FAD can be observed in axons with intact myelin sheaths. Thus, contrary to the classical view, demyelination-a hallmark of multiple sclerosis-is not a prerequisite for axon damage. Instead, focal intra-axonal mitochondrial pathology is the earliest ultrastructural sign of damage, and it precedes changes in axon morphology. Molecular imaging and pharmacological experiments show that macrophage-derived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) can trigger mitochondrial pathology and initiate FAD. Indeed, neutralization of ROS and RNS rescues axons that have already entered the degenerative process. Finally, axonal changes consistent with FAD can be detected in acute human multiple sclerosis lesions. In summary, our data suggest that inflammatory axon damage might be spontaneously reversible and thus a potential target for therapy.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate which measures of trunk sway taken during stance and gait tasks are best correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: We studied 37 MS patients (mean age 43. ± 10 years; 76{\{}{\%}{\}} female; 81{\{}{\%}{\}} relapsing-remitting MS; mean EDSS score 2.8. ± 1.1). The study protocol comprised the subjective Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and recorded peak-to-peak trunk sway angles and velocities during 14 stance and gait balance tasks. 76 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects served as controls (HCs). Results: Patients had significant more trunk sway than HCs (p< 0.001) and EDSS scores were highly correlated with sway measures in 6 of 14 balance tests (rho. > 0.4; p< 0.001). Patients with normal clinical Romberg and tandem gait tests showed significantly more trunk sway than HCs when standing on one leg eyes open on foam support (p< 0.001). Patients with spinal cord manifestation of MS (n= 27) had higher trunk sway compared to patients without. Mean DHI score of the patients was 30. ± 23.5{\{}{\%}{\}}. DHI was highly correlated with trunk sway for all two-legged stance tasks in MS patients. Conclusions: Balance deficits in trunk sway observed in MS patients during stance and gait tasks are highly correlated with their EDSS and DHI scores, with stance and tandem gait tasks providing the highest correlations. Measures of trunk sway during stance balance tests demonstrate a MS-related functional deficit even in patients with normal clinical Romberg and tandem gait tests, and therefore have the potential to provide objective data of sub-clinical deficits. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {During posture control, reflexive feedback allows humans to efficiently compensate for unpredictable mechanical disturbances. Although reflexes are involuntary, humans can adapt their reflexive settings to the characteristics of the disturbances. Reflex modulation is commonly studied by determining reflex gains: a set of parameters that quantify the contributions of Ia, Ib and II afferents to mechanical joint behavior. Many mechanisms, like presynaptic inhibition and fusimotor drive, can account for reflex gain modulations. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of underlying neural and sensory mechanisms on mechanical joint behavior. A neuromusculoskeletal model was built, in which a pair of muscles actuated a limb, while being controlled by a model of 2,298 spiking neurons in six pairs of spinal populations. Identical to experiments, the endpoint of the limb was disturbed with force perturbations. System identification was used to quantify the control behavior with reflex gains. A sensitivity analysis was then performed on the neuromusculoskeletal model, determining the influence of the neural, sensory and synaptic parameters on the joint dynamics. The results showed that the lumped reflex gains positively correlate to their most direct neural substrates: the velocity gain with Ia afferent velocity feedback, the positional gain with muscle stretch over II afferents and the force feedback gain with Ib afferent feedback. However, position feedback and force feedback gains show strong interactions with other neural and sensory properties. These results give important insights in the effects of neural properties on joint dynamics and in the identifiability of reflex gains in experiments.},

Stabilometric tests were applied to 35 subjects (20-51 years, 54-95 kg, 1.6-1.9 m) and the power spectral density function was estimated for the anterior-posterior center of pressure time series. The median frequency was compared between power spectra estimated according to signal partitioning, sampling rate, test duration, and detrending methods. The median frequency reliability for different test durations was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. When increasing number of segments, shortening test duration or applying linear detrending, the median frequency values increased significantly up to 137{\{}{\%}{\}}. Even the shortest test duration provided reliable estimates as observed with the intraclass coefficient (0.74-0.89 confidence interval for a single 20-s test). Clinical assessment of balance may benefit from a standardized protocol for center of pressure spectral analysis that provides an adequate relationship between resolution and variance. An algorithm to estimate center of pressure power density spectrum is also proposed.},

abstract = {Viscoelastic properties of muscles and tendons have an important influence on human motion performance. Proper determination of these properties is essential in the analysis and modelling of human motion dynamics. The purpose of our study was to develop a method for in vivo determination of the viscoelastic properties of the entire triceps surae muscle-tendon complex (MTC) including the gastrocnemius. Ten trained male subjects participated in this study. The measurement procedure consisted of two parts: soleus and Achilles tendon stiffness and viscosity were determined in the first part while the gastrocnemius stiffness and viscosity were determined in the second part. The measurement device and the procedure have been designed in such a manner that as few human body segments move as possible during the measurement. Thus, the measurement uncertainty due to the approximation of the properties of the human body segments was minimized. Triceps surae MTC viscoelastic properties of both legs were measured for each subject. There were no significant differences in viscoelastic coefficients for left and right lower extremities; however, there were noticeable differences between subjects. The soleus stiffness coefficient was greater than the gastrocnemius stiffness coefficient by 87.6 m(-1) in average. For all subjects, soleus viscosity was equal or greater than gastrocnemius viscosity. Values of viscoelastic parameters obtained by our method can be used in the analysis and modelling of human movement in situations where the knee joint is not necessarily flexed and there is coactivation of the soleus and the gastrocnemius.},

abstract = {Correlation structure in the activity of muscles across movements is often interpreted as evidence for low-level, hardwired constraints on upper-limb function. However, muscle synergies may also emerge from optimal strategies to achieve high-level task goals within a redundant control space. To distinguish these contrasting interpretations, we examined the structure of muscle variability during operation of a myoelectric interface in which task constraints were dissociated from natural limb biomechanics. We found that, with practice, human subjects learned to shape patterns of covariation between arbitrary pairs of hand and forearm muscles appropriately for elliptical targets whose orientation varied on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, despite arriving at the same average location in the effector space, performance was improved by buffering variability into those dimensions that least impacted task success. Task modulation of beta-frequency intermuscular coherence indicated that differential recruitment of divergent corticospinal pathways contributed to positive correlations among muscles. However, this feedforward mechanism could not account for negative correlations observed in the presence of visual feedback. A second experiment revealed the development of fast, target-dependent visual responses consistent with "minimum intervention" control correcting predominantly task-relevant errors. Together, these mechanisms contribute to the dynamic emergence of task-specific muscle synergies appropriate for a wide range of abstract task goals.},

abstract = {Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations--e.g., random noise--cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being "suboptimal". Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the "neural code". Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise--via stochastic resonance or otherwise--than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing "noise benefits", and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.},

Time series were collected before and after spinalization at T13 during constant amplitude stimulations of group la muscle afferents in the triceps surae muscle nerves. Using autocorrelation to analyze the linear correlation in the time series demonstrated oscillations in the decerebrate state (4/4) that were eliminated after spinalization (5/5). Three tests for determinism were applied to these series: 1) local flow, 2) local dispersion, and 3) nonlinear prediction. These algorithms were validated with time series generated from known deterministic equations. For each experimental and theoretical time series used, matched ti me-series of stochastic surrogate data were gene rated to serve as mathematical and statistical controls. Two of the ti me series collected in the decerebrate state (2/4) demonstrated evidence for deterministic structure. This structure could not be accounted for by the autocorrelation in the data, and was abolished following spinalization. None of the time series collected in the spinalized state (0/5) demonstrated evidence of determinism. Although monosynaptic reflex variability is generally stochastic in the spinalized state, this simple driven system may display deterministic behavior in the decerebrate state.},

abstract = {Axonal Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) was first described by Feasby et al. in 1986, challenging the existent notion of GBS being a primarily demyelinating disease. The severe course and slow recovery commonly seen in these patients was ascribed to axonal degeneration. Other authors challenged this claim on several grounds. Amidst these controversies, epidemics of a similar illness were reported from China, which were given the acronym AMAN, having exclusive motor involvement in contrast to the cases already described in which both motor and sensory involvement were present (AMSAN). Pathologically, Wallerian degeneration, minimal lymphocytic response, absent demyelination or inflammation and periaxonal macrophages are prominent features. Ultrastructural studies have revealed node of Ranvier to be the prime target of immune attack. A frequent occurrence of antecedent Campylobacter jejuni infection and a strong association between elevated titres of IgG GM1 and axonal GBS on a background of preceding C. jejuni infection has been observed and molecular mimicry between lipopolysaccharides of C. jejuni and neural epitopes has been proposed as a mechanism of injury. Clinically axonal variant is similar to AIDP, but a more severe course, with frequent respiratory involvement, ventilator dependence and significant residue may be seen. Diagnosis is essentially electrophysiological. Treatment is similar to AIDP, preferential benefit of either IVIG or plasmapheresis needs to be further evaluated. A critical review of existing literature in axonal GBS is presented.},

abstract = {The representation of joint position at rest and during movement was investigated in 44 muscle spindle primary afferents originating from the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRb) and extensor digitorum (ED) of normal human subjects. Position sensitivity was estimated for each afferent, and 43 of 44 were position sensitive. In each trial, six sequential ramp-and-hold movements (2-6 degrees, 2 degrees/s, total 24 degrees) flexed the relaxed wrist, beginning from the angle at which the afferent was just recruited. Joint position was represented by three specific features of afferent firing patterns: the steady-state firing rate during the 4-s hold period between ramps, the initial burst at the beginning of each ramp, and the ramp increase in firing rate later in the movement. The position sensitivity of the initial burst (1.27 +/- 0.90 pps/degree, mean +/- SD) was several times higher than that of the hold period (0.40 +/- 0.30 pps/degree) and not different from that of the ramp increase in firing rate (1.36 +/- 0.68 pps/degree). The wrist position sensitivities of ECRb and ED afferents were equivalent, as were their recruitment angles and angular ranges of position sensitivity. Muscle spindle afferents, both individually and as a population, were shown to represent static joint position via the hold rate and the initial burst. Afferents were recruited over the entire 110 degree range of wrist positions investigated; however, the angular range over which each feature represented joint position was extremely limited (approximately 15 degrees). The population response, based on the summed activity of the 43 afferents, was monotonically related to joint position, and it was strongly influenced by the afferent recruitment pattern, but less so by the position sensitivities of the individual afferents.},

abstract = {Impedance modulation has been suggested as a means to suppress the effects of internal noise on movement kinematics. We investigated this hypothesis in a neuro-musculo-skeletal model. A prerequisite is that the muscle model produces realistic force variability. We found that standard Hill-type models do not predict realistic force variability in response to variability in stimulation. In contrast, a combined motor-unit pool model and a pool of parallel Hill-type motor units did produce realistic force variability as a function of target force, largely independent of how the force was transduced to the tendon. To test the main hypothesis, two versions of the latter model were simulated as an antagonistic muscle pair, controlling the position of a frictionless hinge joint, with a distal segment having realistic inertia relative to the muscle strength. Increasing the impedance through co-activation resulted in less kinematic variability, except for the lowest levels of co-activation. Model behavior in this region was affected by the noise amplitude and the inertial properties of the model. Our simulations support the idea that muscular co-activation is in principle an effective strategy to meet accuracy demands.},

abstract = {The question posed in this study is whether optimal control and state estimation can explain selection of control strategies used by humans, in response to small perturbations to stable upright balance. To answer this question, a human sensorimotor control model, compatible with previous work by others, was assembled. This model incorporates linearized equations and full-state feedback with provision for state estimation. A form of gain-scheduling is employed to account for nonlinearities caused by control and biomechanical constraints. By decoupling the mechanics and transforming the controls into the space of experimentally observed strategies, the model is made amenable to the study of a number of possible control objectives. The objectives studied include cost functions on the state deviations, so as to control the center of mass, provide a stable platform for the head, or maintain upright stance, along with a cost function on control effort. Also studied was the effect of time delay on the stability of controls produced using various control strategies. An objective function weighting excursion of the center of mass and deviations from the upright stable position, while taking advantage of fast modes of the system, as dictated by inertial parameters and musculoskeletal geometry, produces a control that reasonably matches experimental data. Given estimates of sensor performance, the model is also suited for prediction of uncertainty in the response.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate, by computer simulation, the role of recurrent inhibition in shaping the input-output (I/O) relationships between descending command signals (DCS) as inputs and motoneuron (MN) and Renshaw cell (RC) firing rates and muscle force as outputs. Changing the spatial (topographical) distribution of recurrent inhibition from nonhomogeneous (as in the standard model) to homogeneous did not alter the I/O relationships significantly, while changing the functional distribution related to MN types did. Altering the global gain of recurrent inhibition, as happens naturally in various motor acts, changes the slopes and positions (at high inputs) of the I/O relationships, making recurrent inhibition a suitable means of gain control. Coupling a decrease in recurrent inhibitory gain with an increase in DCS input, as could occur during slow dynamic contractions, would increase the MN and force gains during the act. Short dynamic ramp-and-hold DCS inputs generate MN firing patterns, to which recurrent inhibition contributes interspike-interval variability and damped oscillations, which are related to issues of tremor and its control.},

abstract = {Modern theories of motor control incorporate forward models that combine sensory information and motor commands to predict future sensory states. Such models circumvent unavoidable neural delays associated with on-line feedback control. Here we show that signals in human muscle spindle afferents during unconstrained wrist and finger movements predict future kinematic states of their parent muscle. Specifically, we show that the discharges of type Ia afferents are best correlated with the velocity of length changes in their parent muscles approximately 100-160 ms in the future and that their discharges vary depending on motor sequences in a way that cannot be explained by the state of their parent muscle alone. We therefore conclude that muscle spindles can act as "forward sensory models": they are affected both by the current state of their parent muscle and by efferent (fusimotor) control, and their discharges represent future kinematic states. If this conjecture is correct, then sensorimotor learning implies learning how to control not only the skeletal muscles but also the fusimotor system.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of motor-unit synchronization on the surface electromyogram (EMG) and isometric force using a computer model of muscle contraction. The EMG and force were simulated by generating muscle fiber action potentials, defining motor-unit mechanical characteristics and territories, estimating motor-unit action potentials, specifying motor-unit discharge times, and imposing various levels of motor-unit synchronization. The output (EMG and force) was simulated at 11 levels of excitation, ranging from 5 to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximum. To synchronize motor-unit activity, selected motor-unit discharge times were adjusted; however, the number of motor units recruited and the average discharge rate of each unit was constant across synchronization conditions for a given level of excitation. Two levels of synchronization were imposed on the discharge times: a moderate and a high level, which approximated the experimentally observed range of motor-unit synchronization. The moderate level of synchrony caused the average EMG to increase by approximately 65{\{}{\%}{\}}, whereas the high level caused a 130{\{}{\%}{\}} increase in the EMG with respect to the no-synchrony condition. Neither synchrony condition influenced the magnitude of the average force. However, motor-unit synchronization did increase the amplitude of the fluctuations in the simulated force, especially at intermediate levels of excitation. In conclusion, motor-unit synchronization increased the amplitude of the average rectified EMG and decreased the steadiness of the force exerted by the muscle in simulated contractions.},

@article{Peterka2000,
abstract = {Collins and De Luca [Collins JJ. De Luca CJ (1993) Exp Brain Res 95: 308-318] introduced a new method known as stabilogram diffusion analysis that provides a quantitative statistical measure of the apparently random variations of center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories recorded during quiet upright stance in humans. This analysis generates a stabilogram diffusion function (SDF) that summarizes the mean square COP displacement as a function of the time interval between COP comparisons. SDFs have a characteristic two-part form that suggests the presence of two different control regimes: a short-term open-loop control behavior and a longer-term closed-loop behavior. This paper demonstrates that a very simple closed-loop control model of upright stance can generate realistic SDFs. The model consists of an inverted pendulum body with torque applied at the ankle joint. This torque includes a random disturbance torque and a control torque. The control torque is a function of the deviation (error signal) between the desired upright body position and the actual body position, and is generated in proportion to the error signal, the derivative of the error signal, and the integral of the error signal [i.e. a proportional, integral and derivative (PID) neural controller]. The control torque is applied with a time delay representing conduction, processing, and muscle activation delays. Variations in the PID parameters and the time delay generate variations in SDFs that mimic real experimental SDFs. This model analysis allows one to interpret experimentally observed changes in SDFs in terms of variations in neural controller and time delay parameters rather than in terms of open-loop versus closed-loop behavior.},

abstract = {In the investigation of corticomuscular coherence (CMC), it remained unclear why some subjects do not present significant CMC. We predicted that such subjects will develop CMC as a result of learning as indexed by improved performance during a visuomotor task. We investigated CMC, cortical motor spectral power (SP), and performance in 14 subjects during isometric compensation of a static force or dynamic force (DF) with their right index finger. We compared data from the beginning of the experiment (Time-Period 1) and after learning (Time-Period 2). Eight subjects (Group CMC++) presented CMC during Period 1 which increased during Period 2. Six subjects (Group CMC-+) presented CMC only during Period 2. Group CMC-+ was "more desynchronized" (lower SP, and stronger task-related desynchronization) than Group CMC++. The performance was better in Group CMC++ than in Group CMC-+. Learning was associated with higher SP, higher CMC, and better performance in both groups. However, in the more complicated DF condition, Group CMC++ learned better than Group CMC-+. The present study demonstrates the presence of CMC in all subjects tested and evidence that this is due to the fact that individuals may fall into 2 different groups in terms of oscillatory motor control: Group CMC-+ presents CMC only after learning.},

abstract = {The sensorimotor system is a product of evolution, development, learning and adaptation-which work on different time scales to improve behavioral performance. Consequently, many theories of motor function are based on 'optimal performance': they quantify task goals as cost functions, and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},

abstract = {Both voluntary and involuntary movements activate sensors in the muscles, skin, tendon and joints. As limb movement can result from a mixture of spinal reflexes and voluntary motor commands, the cortical centres underlying conscious proprioception might either aggregate or separate the sensory inputs generated by voluntary movements from those generated by involuntary movements such as spinal reflexes. We addressed whether healthy volunteers could perceive the contribution of a spinal reflex during movements that combined both reflexive and voluntary contributions. Volunteers reported the reflexive contribution in leg movements that were partly driven by the knee-jerk reflex induced by a patellar tendon tap and partly by voluntary motor control. In one condition, participants were instructed to kick back in response to a tendon tap. The results were compared to reflexes in a resting baseline condition without voluntary movement. In a further condition, participants were instructed to kick forwards after a tap. Volunteers reported the perceived reflex contribution by repositioning the leg to the perceived maximum displacement to which the reflex moved the leg after each tendon tap. In the resting baseline condition, the reflex was accurately perceived. We found a near-unity slope of linear regressions of perceived on actual reflexive displacement. Both the slope value and the quality of regression fit in individual volunteers were significantly reduced when volunteers were instructed to generate voluntary backward kicks as soon as they detected the tap. In the kick forward condition, kinematic analysis showed continuity of reflex and voluntary movements, but the reflex contribution could be estimated from electromyography (EMG) recording on each trial. Again, participants' judgements of reflexes showed a poor relation to reflex EMG, in contrast to the baseline condition. In sum, we show that reflexes can be accurately perceived from afferent information. However, the presence of voluntary movement significantly impairs reflex perception. We suggest that perceptual separation between voluntary and reflex movement is poor at best. Our results imply that the brain has no clear marker for perceptually separating voluntary and involuntary movement. Attribution of body movement to voluntary or involuntary motor commands is surprisingly poor when both are present.},

abstract = {The generation of muscle-actuated simulations that accurately represent the movement of old adults requires a model that accounts for changes in muscle properties that occur with aging. An objective of this study was to adjust the parameters of Hill-type musculo-tendon models to reflect nominal age-related changes in muscle mechanics that have been reported in the literature. A second objective was to determine whether using the parametric adjustments resulted in simulated dynamic ankle torque behavior similar to that seen in healthy old adults. The primary parameter adjustment involved decreasing maximum isometric muscle forces to account for the loss of muscle mass and specific strength with age. A review of the literature suggested the need for other modest adjustments that account for prolonged muscular deactivation, a reduction in maximum contraction velocity; greater passive muscle stiffness and increased normalized force capacity during lengthening contractions. With age-related changes incorporated, a musculo-tendon model was used to simulate isometric and isokinetic contractions of ankle plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles. The model predicted that ankle plantarflexion power output during 120 deg/s shortening contractions would be over 40{\{}{\%}{\}} lower in old adults compared to healthy young adults. These power losses with age exceed the 30{\{}{\%}{\}} loss in isometric strength assumed in the model but are comparable to 39-44{\{}{\%}{\}} reductions in ankle power outputs measured in healthy old adults of approximately 70 years of age. Thus, accounting for age-related changes in muscle properties, other than decreased maximum isometric force, may be particularly important when simulating movements that require substantial power development.},

We asked subjects to apply a force of a specific magnitude with their hand. Subjects could complete the task by applying forces in any direction of their choice in the transverse plane. They were tested with the arm in seven different configurations. To estimate whether contact forces are represented in extrinsic or intrinsic coordinates, we applied the parallel transport method of differential geometry to the net joint torques applied during the task. This approach allowed us to compare the force variability observed at different arm configurations with the force variability that would be expected if the control system were applying an invariant pattern of joint torques at the tested configurations. The results indicate that for the majority of the subjects, the predominant pattern was consistent with an invariant representation in joint coordinates. However, two out of eleven subjects also demonstrated a preference for extrinsic representation. These findings suggest that the central nervous system can represent contact forces in both coordinate frames, with a prevalence toward intrinsic representations.},

The consequences of short-range stiffness and fluctuating muscle activity for proprioception of postural joint rotations: the relevance to human standing. J Neurophysiol 102: 460-474, 2009. First published May 6, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00007.2009. Proprioception comes from muscles and tendons. Tendon compliance, muscle stiffness, and fluctuating activity complicate transduction of joint rotation to a proprioceptive signal. These problems are acute in postural regulation because of tiny joint rotations and substantial short-range muscle stiffness. When studying locomotion or perturbed balance these problems are less applicable. We recently measured short-range stiffness in standing and considered the implications for load stability. Here, using an appropriately simplified model we analyze the conversion of joint rotation to spindle input and tendon tension while considering the effect of short-range stiffness, tendon compliance, fluctuating muscle activity, and fusimotor activity. Basic principles determine that when muscle stiffness and tendon compliance are high, fluctuating muscle activity is the greatest factor confounding registration of postural movements, such as ankle rotations during standing. Passive and isoactive muscle, uncomplicated by active length fluctuations, enable much better registration of joint rotation and require fewer spindles. Short-range muscle stiffness is a degrading factor for spindle input and enhancing factor for Golgi input. Constant fusimotor activity does not enhance spindle registration of postural joint rotations in actively modulated muscle: spindle input remains more strongly associated with muscle activity than joint rotation. A hypothesized rigid alpha-gamma linkage could remove this association with activity but would require large numbers of spindles in active postural muscles. Using microneurography, the existence of a rigid alpha-gamma linkage could be identified from the correlation between spindle output and muscle activity. Basic principles predict a proprioceptive "dead zone" in the active agonist muscle that is related to the short-range muscle stiffness.},

Despite remarkable advances in our understanding of these diseases, no curative treatment for MNDs exists. To better understand the pathogenesis of MNDs and to help develop new treatments, the establishment of animal models that can be studied efficiently and thoroughly is paramount. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly becoming a valuable model for studying human diseases and in screening for potential therapeutics. In this Review, we highlight recent progress in using zebrafish to study the pathology of the most common MNDs: spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). These studies indicate the power of zebrafish as a model to study the consequences of disease-related genes, because zebrafish homologues of human genes have conserved functions with respect to the aetiology of MNDs. Zebrafish also complement other animal models for the study of pathological mechanisms of MNDs and are particularly advantageous for the screening of compounds with therapeutic potential. We present an overview of their potential usefulness in MND drug discovery, which is just beginning and holds much promise for future therapeutic development.},

abstract = {The significant decline in motor neuron number after approximately 60 yr of age is accompanied by a remodeling of the neuromuscular system so that average motor unit force increases and the ability of old adults to produce an intended force declines. One possible explanation for the loss of movement precision is that the remodeling increases the difference in recruitment forces between successively recruited motor units in old adults and this augments force variability at motor unit recruitment. The purpose of the study was to compare the forces and discharge characteristics of motor units in a hand muscle of young and old adults at motor unit recruitment and derecruitment. The difference in recruitment force between pairs of motor units did not differ between young (n=54) and old adults (n=56; P=0.702). However, old adults had a greater proportion of contractions in which motor units discharged action potentials transiently before discharging continuously during the ramp increase in force (young: 0.32; old: 0.41; P=0.045). Force variability at motor unit recruitment was greater for old adults compared with young adults (P<or=0.010), but discharge rate and discharge variability did not differ between age groups (P>or=0.729). These results suggest that the difference in force between the recruitment of successive motor units does not differ between age groups, but that motor unit recruitment may be more transient and could contribute to the greater variability in force observed in old adults during graded ramp contractions.},

abstract = {In literature, it has been suggested that the CNS anticipates spontaneous change in body position during quiet stance and continuously modulates ankle extensor muscle activity to compensate for the change. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether velocity feedback contributes by modulating ankle extensor activities in an anticipatory fashion, facilitating effective control of quiet stance. Both theoretical analysis and experiments were carried out to investigate to what extent velocity feedback contributes to controlling quiet stance. The experiments were carried out with 16 healthy subjects who were asked to stand quietly with their eyes open or closed. During the experiments, the center of pressure (COP) displacement (COPdis), the center of mass (COM) displacement (COMdis), and COM velocity (COMvel) in the anteroposterior direction were measured. Rectified electromyograms (EMGs) were used to measure muscle activity in the right soleus muscle, the medial gastrocnemius muscle, and the lateral gastrocnemius muscle. The simulations were performed using an inverted pendulum model that described the anteroposterior kinematics and dynamics of quiet stance. In the simulations, an assumption was made that the COMdis of the body would be regulated using a proportional-derivative (PD) controller. Two different PD controllers were evaluated in these simulations: 1) a controller with the high-derivative/velocity gain (HDG) and 2) a controller with the low-derivative/velocity gain (LDG). Cross-correlation analysis was applied to investigate the relationships between time series obtained in experiments 1) COMdis and EMGs and 2) COMvel and EMGs. Identical cross-correlation analysis was applied to investigate the relationships between time series obtained in simulations 3) COMdis and ankle torque and 4) COMvel and ankle torque. The results of these analyses showed that the COMdis was positively correlated with all three EMGs and that the EMGs temporally preceded the COMdis. These findings agree with the previously published studies in which it was shown that the lateral gastrocnemius muscle is actively modulated in anticipation of the body's COM position change. The COMvel and all three EMGs were also correlated and the cross-correlation function (CCF) had two peaks: one that was positive and another that was negative. The positive peaks were statistically significant, unlike the negative ones; they were larger than the negative peaks; and their time shifts were much shorter compared with the time shifts of the negative peaks. When these results were compared with the CCF results obtained for simulated time series, it was discovered that the cross-correlation results for the HDG controller closely matched cross-correlation results for the experimental time series. On the other hand, the simulation result obtained for LDG controller did not match the experimental results. These findings suggest that the actual postural control system during quiet stance adopts a control strategy that relies notably on velocity information and that such a controller can modulate muscle activity in anticipatory manner without using a feed-forward mechanism.},

abstract = {The organization of the neural input to motoneurons that underlies time-varying muscle force is assumed to depend on muscle transfer characteristics and neural strategies or control modes utilizing sensory signals. We jointly addressed these interlinked, but previously studied individually and partially, issues for sinusoidal (range 0.5-5.0 Hz) force-tracking contractions of a human finger muscle. Using spectral and correlation analyses of target signal, force signal, and motor unit (MU) discharges, we studied 1) patterns of such discharges, allowing inferences on the motoneuronal input; 2) transformation of MU population activity (EMG) into quasi-sinusoidal force; and 3) relation of force oscillation to target, carrying information on the input's organization. A broad view of force control mechanisms and strategies emerged. Specifically, synchronized MU and EMG modulations, reflecting a frequency-modulated motoneuronal input, accompanied the force variations. Gain and delay drops between EMG modulation and force oscillation, critical for the appropriate organization of this input, occurred with increasing target frequency. According to our analyses, gain compensation was achieved primarily through rhythmical activation/deactivation of higher-threshold MUs and secondarily through the adaptation of the input's strength expected during tracking tasks. However, the input's timing was not adapted to delay behaviors and seemed to depend on the control modes employed. Thus, for low-frequency targets, the force oscillation was highly coherent with, but led, a target, this timing error being compatible with predictive feedforward control partly based on the target's derivatives. In contrast, the force oscillation was weakly coherent, but in phase, with high-frequency targets, suggesting control mainly based on a target's rhythm.},

abstract = {Functional electrical stimulation can assist paralyzed individuals to perform functional movements, but muscle fatigue is a major limitation to its practical use. An accurate and predictive mathematical model can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns that optimize aspects of the force transient while minimizing fatigue. Solution nonuniqueness, a major shortcoming in previous work, was overcome with a simpler model. The model was tested on data collected during isometric contractions of rat gastrocnemius muscles and human quadriceps femoris muscles under various physiological conditions. For each condition tested, parameter values were identified using the force response to one or two stimulation trains. The parameterized model was then used to predict forces in response to other stimulation patterns. The predicted forces closely matched the measured forces. The model was not sensitive to initial parameter estimates, demonstrating solution uniqueness. By predicting the force that develops in response to an arbitrary pattern of stimulation, we envision the present model helping identify optimal stimulation patterns for activation of skeletal muscle during functional electrical stimulation.},

abstract = {It has been known for many years that the power of beta-band oscillatory activity in motor-related brain regions decreases during the preparation and execution of voluntary movements. However, it is not clear yet whether the amplitude of this desynchronization is modulated by any parameter of the motor task. Here, we examined whether the degree of uncertainty about the upcoming movement direction modulated beta-band desynchronization during motor preparation. To this end, we recorded whole-head neuromagnetic signals while human subjects performed an instructed-delay reaching task with one, two, or three possible target directions. We found that the reduction of power of beta-band activity (16-28 Hz) during motor preparation was scaled relative to directional uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that the change of beta-band power correlates with the change of latency of response associated with response uncertainty. Finally, we show that the main source of beta-band desynchronization was located in the peri-Rolandic region. The results establish directional uncertainty as an important determinant of beta-band power during motor preparation and indicate that neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex during motor preparation covaries with directional uncertainty.},

abstract = {Synchronised neuronal oscillations at beta frequencies are prevalent in the human motor system, but their function is unclear. In this Opinion article, we propose that the levels of beta oscillations provide a measure of the likelihood that a new voluntary action will need to be actuated. Oscillatory beta activity is in turn modulated by net dopamine levels at sites of cortical input to the basal ganglia. We hypothesise that net dopamine levels are modulated in response to salient internal and external cues. Crucially, the resulting modulation of beta activity is predictive, enabling the appropriate prospective resourcing and preparation of potential actions. Loss of dopamine, as in Parkinson's disease, annuls this function, unless net dopaminergic activity can be elevated through medication.},

abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to examine if there are changes in the intrinsic properties of spinal motoneurons after prolonged submaximal contractions. To do this, we assessed whether or not the synaptic drive to motoneurons needs to increase in order to maintain a constant firing rate of a motor unit. Recruitment of new units and an increase in total electromyographic (EMG) activity of the muscle of interest were taken as estimates of an increase in synaptic drive. Subjects were asked to maintain a constant firing rate of a clearly identifiable (targeted) motor unit from the first dorsal interosseous muscle for approximately 10 min, while surface EMG and force were recorded simultaneously. For the 60 units studied, the duration of the constant-firing-rate period ranged from 73 to 1,140 s (448+/-227 s; mean+/-SD). There was a significant increase (t-test, p<0.001) in the magnitude of mean surface EMG, and DC force while the targeted motoneuron maintained a constant rate suggesting an increase in the net excitatory input to the motoneuron pool. Changes occurring simultaneously in other parameters, namely, variability in interspike interval, magnitude of force fluctuations, the duration of motor unit action potentials, and the median power frequency of surface EMG were also computed. The firing rates of 16 concurrently firing motoneurons, not controlled by the subject, remained constant. The key finding of this study is that after prolonged activity, a motoneuron requires a stronger excitatory input to maintain its firing rate. Additional results are indicative of significant changes in the characteristics of the synaptic inputs, changes at the neuromuscular junction (both pre- and postsynaptic regions) and the sarcolemma.},

abstract = {The maintenance of quiet stance requires the activation of muscles bilaterally. The soleus muscles in each leg share a common function in standing; that is, each muscle acts to control antero-posterior (AP) sway on its own side. We sought to determine the extent to which oscillations in motor unit discharge were related in motor unit pairs of the soleus muscles during postural and voluntary isometric tasks, both within and between legs. Subjects stood quietly for 5 min or performed a voluntary isometric plantarflexion contraction in a seated position. During the postural tasks, the excursions of AP sway between legs were highly correlated (rho = 0.86 +/- 0.06). The strength of common modulation of motor unit discharge rates was assessed using time- and frequency-domain analyses. The time-domain common drive analysis revealed that the strongest correlation in motor unit discharge modulation occurred in the postural task with unilateral pairs (rho = 0.71 +/- 0.13) being more strongly correlated than bilateral pairs (rho = 0.50 +/- 0.16). Common modulation of motor unit discharge was lowest for the voluntary tasks, with rho = 0.38 +/- 0.11 and 0.16 +/- 0.08 for unilateral and bilateral pairs, respectively. Similarly, the frequency-domain coherence analysis demonstrated an identical ordering effect, with the largest maximum pooled coherence occurring during standing posture in unilateral (0.070 at 1.6 Hz) and bilateral (0.055 at 1.6 Hz) recordings, whereas minimal coherence was observed in the voluntary task in both unilateral and bilateral recordings within the 0-5 Hz range. These results indicate that in the soleus muscle, common modulation of motor unit discharge is greater during postural tasks than during voluntary isometric tasks and can be observed in both bilateral and unilateral motor unit pairs. Differences in the extent of co-modulation of motor unit discharge between tasks may be attributed to either differences in the descending control or differences in the proprioceptive input between postural and isometric tasks.},

abstract = {This review describes a novel view on stages in motor learning based on recent developments of the notion of synergies, the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, and the equilibrium-point hypothesis (referent configuration) that allow to merge these notions into a single scheme of motor control. The principle of abundance and the principle of minimal final action form the foundation for analyses of natural motor actions performed by redundant sets of elements. Two main stages of motor learning are introduced corresponding to (1) discovery and strengthening of motor synergies stabilizing salient performance variable(s) and (2) their weakening when other aspects of motor performance are optimized. The first stage may be viewed as consisting of two steps, the elaboration of an adequate referent configuration trajectory and the elaboration of multi-joint (multi-muscle) synergies stabilizing the referent configuration trajectory. Both steps are expected to lead to more variance in the space of elemental variables that is compatible with a desired time profile of the salient performance variable ("good variability"). Adjusting control to other aspects of performance during the second stage (for example, esthetics, energy expenditure, time, fatigue, etc.) may lead to a drop in the "good variability". Experimental support for the suggested scheme is reviewed.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the levels of voluntary isometric contraction on the Hoffman reflex in human soleus and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles. H-reflexes were recorded in sixteen healthy adults at each of 16 isometric plantarflexion (pf) torque levels ranging from 0-100{\%} of their maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) and were elicited at two intensities of stimulation: (i) supramaximal for M-response and (ii) a submaximal stimulus that produced an H-reflex in soleus that was 50{\%} of maximum H-reflex at rest. The H-reflex peak-to-peak amplitudes were linearly related to pf torque levels ranging from O to 50{\%} MVC at both supramaximal and submaximal stimulus intensities. The slope of this relationship was higher for the submaximal stimulation. Beyond 60{\%} of MVC, the soleus H-reflex amplitude showed no further increase with increasing pf torque for both stimulus intensities. Thus, beyond 50-60{\%} of MVC the soleus H-reflex does not provide an accurate measure of soleus motor neuron pool excitability. Further experimental results showed that the H-reflex amplitude at a given torque level depended on whether torque was increasing or decreasing. When torque was increasing, the amplitude of the H-reflex was larger than when the same torque was maintained at a constant level. In contrast, if the torque was decreasing, amplitude of the reflex was lower than when torque was increasing. Therefore, variations in H-reflex amplitudes at a given torque level may be more closely correlated to the direction of the ongoing contraction than to the actual muscle force being produced at the time the H-reflex is elicited.},

abstract = {There is considerable debate over whether the brain codes information using neural firing rate or the fine-grained structure of spike timing. We investigated this issue in spike discharge recorded from single units in the sensorimotor cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei, and dorsal root ganglia in macaque monkeys trained to perform a finger flexion task. The task required flexion to four different displacements against two opposing torques; the eight possible conditions were randomly interleaved. We used information theory to assess coding of task condition in spike rate, discharge irregularity, and spectral power in the 15- to 25-Hz band during the period of steady holding. All three measures coded task information in all areas tested. Information coding was most often independent between irregularity and 15-25 Hz power (60{\%} of units), moderately redundant between spike rate and irregularity (56{\%} of units redundant), and highly redundant between spike rate and power (93{\%}). Most simultaneously recorded unit pairs coded using the same measure independently (86{\%}). Knowledge of two measures often provided extra information about task, compared with knowledge of only one alone. We conclude that sensorimotor systems use both rate and temporal codes to represent information about a finger movement task. As well as offering insights into neural coding, this work suggests that incorporating spike irregularity into algorithms used for brain-machine interfaces could improve decoding accuracy.},

@article{Jablonka2014,
abstract = {In motoneuron disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the loss of synapses and axon branches occurs early but is compensated by sprouting of neighboring axon terminals. Defective local axonal signaling for maintenance and dynamics of the axonal microtubule and actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in this context. The molecular mechanisms that lead to defective cytoskeleton architecture in two mouse models of motoneuron disease are summarized and discussed in this manuscript. In the progressive motor neuropathy (pmn) mouse model of motoneuron disease that is caused by a mutation in the tubulin-specific chaperone E gene, death of motoneuron cell bodies appears as a consequence of axonal degeneration. Treatment with bcl-2 overexpression or with glial-derived neurotrophic factor prevents loss of motoneuron cell bodies but does not influence the course of disease. In contrast, treatment with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) significantly delays disease onset and prolongs survival of pmn mice. This difference is due to the activation of Stat-3 via the CNTF receptor complex in axons of pmn mutant motoneurons. Most of the activated Stat-3 protein is not transported to the nucleus to activate transcription, but interacts locally in axons with stathmin, a protein that destabilizes microtubules. This interaction plays a major role in CNTF signaling for microtubule dynamics in axons. In Smn-deficient mice, a model of spinal muscular atrophy, defects in axonal translocation of $\beta$-actin mRNA and possibly other mRNA species have been observed. Moreover, the regulation of local protein synthesis in response to signals from neurotrophic factors and extracellular matrix proteins is altered in motoneurons from this model of motoneuron disease. These findings indicate that local signals are important for maintenance and plasticity of axonal branches and neuromuscular endplates, and that disturbances in these signaling mechanisms could contribute to the pathophysiology of motoneuron diseases.},

This symptom, which can be severely disabling and embarrassing for patients, is difficult to manage. Isoniazid in high doses, carbamazepine, propranolol and gluthetimide have been reported to provide some relief, but published evidence of effectiveness is very limited. Most trials were of small size and of short duration. Cannabinoids appear ineffective. Tremor reduction can be obtained with stereotactic thalamotomy or thalamic stimulation. However, the studies were small and information on long-term functional outcome is scarce. Physiotherapy, tremor reducing orthoses, and limb cooling can achieve some functional improvement. Tremor in MS remains a significant challenge and unmet need, requiring further basic and clinical research.},

abstract = {This paper extends the systematic approach described in Winters and Stark (62) for developing muscle models. The underlying motivation is our finding that for larger scale shoulder and head-neck postural systems to be mechanically stable, open-loop muscle properties are often not sufficient. There are three primary contributions. First, the previous muscle mechanical model structure and parameter estimation process of (62) is updated to reflect recent experimental findings. Second, an intrafusal (IF) muscle model is developed that includes a gamma(static) motoneuron (MN) drive, a Hill muscle model, and a muscle spindle sensor across the IF series element; this provides a more appropriate muscle spindle output signal, especially for studies of posture. Third, the conceptual cut between the neurocontrol input and the actuator is raised from just below the MN summing junction to a higher location, allowing a muscle-reflex actuator'' to be defined that satisfies the formal theoretical requirement for possessing passive spring-like behavior when the neurocontrol input is constant, alpha-gamma MN coactivation is assumed, and three types of intrinsic autogenic reflex responses (spindle, Golgi tendon organ, Rhenshaw cell) are developed. Default feedback gains are set based on the criteria that inherent feedback should not sculpt the feedforward excitation drive by more than +/- 10{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximum. This new actuator model only mildly affects voluntary goal-directed dynamic performance, but enhances spring-like performance around the postural equilibrium state, in line with available animal and human studies and with several theories on postural regulation.},

abstract = {Limb resonance imparts a characteristic spectrum to hand tremor. Movement will alter the resonance. We have examined the consequences of this change. Rectified forearm extensor muscle EMG and physiological hand tremor were recorded. In postural conditions the EMG spectrum is relatively flat whereas the acceleration spectrum is sharply peaked. Consequently, the gain between EMG and acceleration is maximal at the frequency where the tremor is largest (∼8 Hz). The shape of the gain curve implies mechanical resonance. Substantial alterations in posture do not significantly change the characteristics of the tremor or the shape or size of the gain curve. By contrast, slow or moderately paced voluntary wrist flexion–extension movements dramatically increase the hand tremor size and lower its peak frequency. These changes in size and frequency of the tremor cannot be attributed to changes in the EMG. Instead they reflect a very large change in the size and shape of the gain curve relating EMG to acceleration. The gain becomes larger and the peak moves to a lower frequency (∼6 Hz). We suggest that a movement-related (thixotropic) alteration in resonant properties of the wrist provides a simple explanation for these changes. The mechanism is illustrated by a model. Our new findings confirm that resonance plays a major role in wrist tremor. We also demonstrate that muscles operate very differently under postural and dynamic conditions. The different coupling between EMG and movement in posture and when moving must pose a considerable challenge for neural predictive control of skeletal muscles.},

The measures that identified differences between the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions in the young adult group were different than those that identified differences between the eye conditions in the elderly adult group. Mean velocity of the COP was the only measure that identified age-related changes in both eye conditions, and differences between eye conditions in both groups.

This paper reports a model for predicting the force produced by an isometric skeletal muscle at rest length in response to a wide range of stimulation patterns. The model consists of two linear, first-order systems separated by a static nonlinearity. The rate constant of the second first-order system varies with force level. The model was validated using three cat soleus and three cat plantaris muscles, The following whole-nerve stimulation trains were used: single pulses (twitches), 2-4 pulses, constant rates, triangularly modulated interpulse intervals, and randomly modulated interpulse intervals. The model reproduced most responses accurately. The model shows that a force-dependent rate constant is essential for model validity, and could be used in the control of neuroprostheses.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Understanding the detailed control of human locomotion and balance can be improved, when individual motor units can be isolated and their firing rates followed in natural movement of large, fuctionally important muscles. For this reason the present study investigated the motor unit discharge rate (MUDR) in isometric and dynamic contractions of the soleus muscle. METHODS: Eleven males performed isometric (10-100{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC) and dynamic (10-40{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC) plantar flexions. Intramuscular EMG was measured from Soleus with bipolar wire-electrodes and decomposed with custom built "Daisy" software. RESULTS: The Soleus MUDR was significantly higher in concentric compared to isometric or eccentric contractions at all submaximal force levels (P<0.05). In isometric contractions MUDR increased up to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC. CONCLUSION: Motor unit discharge properties of a large plantarflexor can be measured in dynamic and maximal contractions. For a given torque output, MUDR is dependent upon contraction type, as set by the major mechanical differences between concentric and eccentric actions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This chapter summarizes the role of the vestibular system in postural control so that specific and effective rehabilitation can be designed that facilitates compensation for loss of vestibular function. METHODS: Patients with bilateral or unilateral loss of peripheral vestibular function are exposed to surface perturbations to quantify automatic postural responses. Studies also evaluated the effects of audio- and vibrotactile-biofeedback to improve stability in stance and gait. RESULTS: The most important role of vestibular information for postural control is to control orientation of the head and trunk in space with respect to gravitoinertial forces, particularly when balancing on unstable surfaces. Vestibular sensory references are particularly important for postural control at high frequencies and velocities of self-motion, to reduce trunk drift and variability, to provide an external reference frame for the trunk and head in space; and to uncouple coordination of the trunk from the legs and the head-in-space from the body CoM. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of balance rehabilitation for patients with vestibular loss is to help patients 1) use remaining vestibular function, 2) depend upon surface somatosensory information as their primary postural sensory system, 3) learn to use stable visual references, and 4) identify efficient and effective postural movement strategies.},

abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation can generate contractions through both peripheral and central mechanisms. The peripheral mechanism involves the direct activation of motor axons, while the central mechanism involves the activation of sensory axons that recruit spinal neurons through a reflex pathway. For use in functional electrical stimulation. One must have control over turning the central mechanism on and off. We investigated whether inhibition developed through antagonist muscle (tibialis anterior, TA) contractions elicited by electrical stimulation or by volition can turn off the central mechanism in triceps surae. Both electrical stimulation and voluntary contractions of TA reduced or eliminated plantar flexion torque produced by the central mechanism, indicating that inhibition induced via these contractions can effectively turn off the central contribution to force. These findings suggest that patterns of electrical stimulation may be able to generate periodic muscle contractions by turning the central contribution to muscular contractions on and off.},

@article{Fitzpatrick2004,
abstract = {Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is a simple, safe, and specific way to elicit vestibular reflexes. Yet, despite a long history, it has only recently found popularity as a research tool and is rarely used clinically. The obstacle to advancing and exploiting GVS is that we cannot interpret the evoked responses with certainty because we do not understand how the stimulus acts as an input to the system. This paper examines the electrophysiology and anatomy of the vestibular organs and the effects of GVS on human balance control and develops a model that explains the observed balance responses. These responses are large and highly organized over all body segments and adapt to postural and balance requirements. To achieve this, neurons in the vestibular nuclei receive convergent signals from all vestibular receptors and somatosensory and cortical inputs. GVS sway responses are affected by other sources of information about balance but can appear as the sum of otolithic and semicircular canal responses. Electrophysiological studies showing similar activation of primary afferents from the otolith organs and canals and their convergence in the vestibular nuclei support this. On the basis of the morphology of the cristae and the alignment of the semicircular canals in the skull, rotational vectors calculated for every mode of GVS agree with the observed sway. However, vector summation of signals from all utricular afferents does not explain the observed sway. Thus we propose the hypothesis that the otolithic component of the balance response originates from only the pars medialis of the utricular macula.},

The gain and phase relations between an applied stretch, whiclh initiates the reflex, and the output of the primary mulscle spindles, which impinge upon (alpha)-motoneurons, are not further changed by the properties of the motoneurons. The dynamic relation between motoneuron activity and the resultant muscle tension balances these changes in gain and phase; the result is a flat gain and nearly zero phase difference between stretch and tension produced by the myotatic reflex. Moreover, the distribution of activity in multiple channels extends the range in which the overall reflex is linear.},

abstract = {The effect of skin, muscle, fat, and bone tissue on simulated surface electromyographic (EMG) signals was examined using a finite-element model. The amplitude and frequency content of the surface potential were observed to increase when the outer layer of a homogeneous muscle model was replaced with highly resistive skin or fat tissue. The rate at which the surface potential decreased as the fiber was moved deeper within the muscle also increased. Similarly, the rate at which the surface potential decayed around the surface of the model, for a constant fiber depth, increased. When layers of subcutaneous fat of increasing thickness were then added to the model, EMG amplitude, frequency content, and the rate of decay of the surface EMG signal around the limb decreased, due to the increased distance between the electrodes and the active fiber. The influence of bone on the surface potential was observed to vary considerably, depending on its location. When located close to the surface of the volume conductor, the surface EMG signal between the bone and the source and directly over the bone increased, accompanied by a slight decrease on the side of the bone distal to the active fiber. The results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the effects of material properties and the distance between source and electrode when considering the influence of subcutaneous tissue, and suggest possible distortions in the surface EMG signal in regions where a bone is located close to the skin surface.},

abstract = {A new method for eye movement artefacts removal based on independent component analysis (ICA) and recursive least squares (RLS) is presented. The proposed algorithm combines the effective ICA capacity of separating artefacts from brain waves, together with the online interference cancellation achieved by adaptive filtering. Eye blink, saccades, eyes opening and closing produce changes of potentials at frontal areas. For this reason, the method uses as a reference the electrodes closest to the eyes Fp1, Fp2, F7 and F8, which register vertical and horizontal eye movements in the electroencephalogram (EEG) caused by these activities as an alternative of using extra dedicated electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes, which could not always be available and could be subject to larger variability. Both reference signals and EEG components are first projected into ICA domain and then the interference is estimated using the RLS algorithm. The component related to EOG artefact is automatically eliminated using channel localisations. Results from experimental data demonstrate that this approach is suitable for eliminating artefacts caused by eye movements, and the principles of this method can be extended to certain other artefacts as well, whenever a correlated reference signal is available.},

@article{Seynnes2008,
abstract = {AIM: To investigate the influence of tendinous and synaptic changes induced by unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) on the tendon tap reflex. METHODS: Eight young men underwent a 23-day period of ULLS. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), torque and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the plantar flexor muscles (normalized to the M wave), Achilles tendon-aponeurosis mechanical properties, soleus (SOL) H and T reflexes and associated peak twitch torques were measured at baseline, after 14 and 23 days of ULLS, and 1 week after resuming ambulatory activity. RESULTS: Significant decreases in muscle CSA (-9{\%}), in maximal voluntary torque (-10{\%}) and in the associated SOL EMG activity (-16{\%}) were found after ULLS (P < 0.05). In addition to a 36{\%} (P < 0.01) decrease in tendon-aponeurosis stiffness, normalized H reflex increased by 35{\%} (P < 0.05). An increase in the slope (28{\%}, P < 0.05) and intercept (85{\%}, P < 0.05) of the T reflex recruitment curve pointed to an increase in the gain and to a decrease in the sensitivity of this reflex, possibly resulting from the decrease in the tendon-aponeurosis stiffness at low forces. Following ULLS, changes in tendinous stiffness correlated with changes in neuromuscular efficiency (peak twitch torque to reflex ratio) at higher tendon tap forces. CONCLUSION: These findings point out the dual and antagonistic influences of spinal and tendinous adaptations upon the tendon tap reflex in humans under conditions of chronic unloading. These observations have potential implications for the sensitivity of the short-latency Ia stretch response involved in rapid compensatory contractions to unexpected postural perturbations.},

abstract = {Neurological disorders of volition may be characterized by deficits in willing and/or agency. When we move our bodies through space, it is the sense that we intended to move (willing) and that our actions were a consequence of this intention (self-agency) that gives us the sense of voluntariness and a general feeling of being "in control." While it is possible to have movements that share executive machinery ordinarily used for voluntary movement but lack a sense of voluntariness, such as psychogenic movement disorders, it is also possible to claim volition for presumed involuntary movements (early chorea) or even when no movement is produced (anosognosia). The study of such patients should enlighten traditional models of how the percepts of volition are generated in the brain with regard to movement. We discuss volition and its components as multi-leveled processes with feedforward and feedback information flow, and dependence on prior expectations as well as external and internal cues.},

Patients whose discharge was delayed tended to be older, to have delirium and/or dementia, to more often come from or require transfer to long term care (LTC) institutions, and/or to be dependent in essential activities of daily living. The 4-Score, an index for predicting non-medical days, was useful in identifying patients at risk for delays in discharge, and had a sensitivity of 0.82, and a specificity of 0.90. Interventions to reduce delays in discharge must address the frail nature of the patients, their lack of support and existing administrative relationships with LTC institutions. Acute care hospitals will likely need to undertake formal programs for the long term care of many of these patients.},

abstract = {We have examined dynamic stiffness at the human ankle using position perturbations which were designed to provide a wide-bandwidth input with low average velocity. A parallel-cascade, nonlinear system identification technique was used to separate overall stiffness into intrinsic and reflex components. Intrinsic stiffness was described by a linear, second-order system similar to that demonstrated previously. Reflex stiffness dynamics were more complex, comprising a delay, a unidirectional rate-sensitive element and then lowpass dynamics. Reflex mechanisms were found to be most important at frequencies of 5-10 Hz. The gain and dynamics of reflex stiffness varied strongly with the parameters of the perturbation, the gain decreasing as the mean velocity of the perturbation increased. Under some conditions, torques generated by reflex mechanisms were of the same magnitude as those from intrinsic mechanisms. It is concluded that reflex stiffness can be large enough to be important functionally, but that its effects will depend strongly upon the particular conditions.},

abstract = {Anthropological and biomechanical research suggests that the human foot evolved a unique design for propulsion and support. In theory, the arch and toes must play an important role, however, many postural studies tend to focus on the simple hinge action of the ankle joint. To investigate further the role of foot anatomy and sensorimotor control of posture, we quantified the deformation of the foot arch and studied the effects of local perturbations applied to the toes (TOE) or 1st/2nd metatarsals (MT) while standing. In sitting position, loading and lifting a 10-kg weight on the knee respectively lowered and raised the foot arch between 1 and 1.5 mm. Less than 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of this change could be accounted for by plantar surface skin compression. During quiet standing, the foot arch probe and shin sway revealed a significant correlation, which shows that as the tibia tilts forward, the foot arch flattens and vice versa. During TOE and MT perturbations (a 2- to 6-mm upward shift of an appropriate part of the foot at 2.5 mm/s), electromyogram (EMG) measures of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius revealed notable changes, and the root-mean-square (RMS) variability of shin sway increased significantly, these increments being greater in the MT condition. The slow return of RMS to baseline level (>30 s) suggested that a very small perturbation changes the surface reference frame, which then takes time to reestablish. These findings show that rather than serving as a rigid base of support, the foot is compliant, in an active state, and sensitive to minute deformations. In conclusion, the architecture and physiology of the foot appear to contribute to the task of bipedal postural control with great sensitivity.},

abstract = {The present study investigated motor unit (MU) loss in a murine model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The fast-twitch tibialis anterior (TA) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles of transgenic SOD1(G93A) and SOD1(WT) mice were studied during the presymptomatic phase of disease progression at 60 days of age. Whole muscle maximum isometric twitch and tetanic forces were 80{\{}{\%}{\}} lower (P < 0.01) in the TA muscles of SOD1(G93A) compared to SOD1(WT) mice. Enumeration of total MU numbers within TA muscles showed a 60{\{}{\%}{\}} reduction (P < 0.01) within SOD1(G93A) mice (38 +/- 7) compared with SOD1(WT) controls (95 +/- 12); this was attributed to a lower proportion of the most forceful fast-fatigable (FF) MU in SOD1(G93A) mice, as seen by a significant (P < 0.01) leftward shift in the cumulative frequency histogram of single MU forces. Similar patterns of MU loss and corresponding decreases in isometric twitch force were observed in the MG. Immunocytochemical analyses of the entire cross-sectional area (CSA) of serial sections of TA muscles stained with anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and various monoclonal antibodies for myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms showed respective 65{\{}{\%}{\}} (P < 0.01) and 28{\{}{\%}{\}} (P < 0.05) decreases in the number of innervated IIB and IID/X muscle fibres in SOD1(G93A), which paralleled the 60{\{}{\%}{\}} decrease (P < 0.01) in the force generating capacity of individual fibres. The loss of fast MUs was partially compensated by activity-dependent fast-to-slower fibre type transitions, as determined by increases (P < 0.04) in the CSA and proportion of IIA fibres (from 4{\{}{\%}{\}} to 14{\{}{\%}{\}}) and IID/X fibres (from 31{\{}{\%}{\}} to 39{\{}{\%}{\}}), and decreases (P < 0.001) in the CSA and proportion of type IIB fibres (from 65{\{}{\%}{\}} to 44{\{}{\%}{\}}). We conclude that preferential loss of IIB fibres is incomplete at 60 days of age, and is consistent with a selective albeit gradual loss of FF MUs that is not fully compensated by sprouting of the remaining motoneurons that innervate type IIA or IID/X muscle fibres. Our findings indicate that disease progression in fast-twitch muscles of SOD1(G93A) mice involves parallel processes: (1) gradual selective motor axon die-back of the FF motor units that contain large type IIB muscle fibres, and of fatigue-intermediate motor units that innervate type IID/X muscle fibres, and (2) activity-dependent conversion of motor units to those innervated by smaller motor axons innervating type IIA fatigue-resistant muscle fibres.},

Centre of mass (CoM), centre of pressure (CoP) and electromyogram (EMG) or similar measures are commonly recorded to quantify human balance control. In this paper we show that to identify the rigid body dynamics and the physiological mechanism that controls the body separately, one has to externally perturb the body with known perturbations and to use the indirect (IA) or joint input-output approach (JA) for identification. However, in many balance control studies the direct approach (DA) have been used, which is well suited to study open-loop systems but will give erroneous results when applied to a closed-loop system, as in human balance control. The cross-correlation function and linear regression are examples of the erroneous application of the DA approach in human balance control studies. The consequences of this erroneous DA are given. In addition a new application of the JA is presented that identifies physiological mechanisms that control balance, including passive and active feedback pathways. This new method is compared with existing identification schemes that use the IA and an existing JA that estimates the active pathway. Also it is shown how descriptive measures such as the power spectral densities (PSD) or the stabilogram diffusion plot (SDP) of the CoP and/or CoM depends on the PSD of internal perturbations and sensor noise, which are not measured. Although descriptive measures can be used to describe the state of the balance control system for a particular situation, it does not separate the dynamics of unknown processes that perturb balance from the dynamics of the active and passive feedback mechanisms that controls balance. Only the IA and the preferred JA can give estimates of the passive and active passive feedback mechanisms that control balance.},

abstract = {Most conventional robots rely on controlling the location of the center of pressure to maintain balance, relying mainly on foot pressure sensors for information. By contrast, humans rely on sensory data from multiple sources, including proprioceptive, visual, and vestibular sources. Several models have been developed to explain how humans reconcile information from disparate sources to form a stable sense of balance. These models may be useful for developing robots that are able to maintain dynamic balance more readily using multiple sensory sources. Since these information sources may conflict, reliance by the nervous system on any one channel can lead to ambiguity in the system state. In humans, experiments that create conflicts between different sensory channels by moving the visual field or the support surface indicate that sensory information is adaptively reweighted. Unreliable information is rapidly down-weighted, then gradually up-weighted when it becomes valid again. Human balance can also be studied by building robots that model features of human bodies and testing them under similar experimental conditions. We implement a sensory reweighting model based on an adaptive Kalman filter in a bipedal robot, and subject it to sensory tests similar to those used on human subjects. Unlike other implementations of sensory reweighting in robots, our implementation includes vision, by using optic flow to calculate forward rotation using a camera (visual modality), as well as a three-axis gyro to represent the vestibular system (non-visual modality), and foot pressure sensors (proprioceptive modality). Our model estimates measurement noise in real time, which is then used to recompute the Kalman gain on each iteration, improving the ability of the robot to dynamically balance. We observe that we can duplicate many important features of postural sway in humans, including automatic sensory reweighting, effects, constant phase with respect to amplitude, and a temporal asymmetry in the reweighting gains.},

abstract = {Pathophysiological changes in basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits are well established in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains open whether such alterations already occur at early stages representing a characteristic neurophysiological marker of PD. Therefore, the present study aims at elucidating changes of synchronised oscillatory activity in early PD patients. In this study, we performed whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a resting condition and during steady state contraction of the more severely affected forearm in 10 drug–naive, de novo patients, in 10 early-stage patients with chronic medication and in 10 age-matched control subjects. While cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) did not differ between groups, patients showed increased sensori-motor cortical power at beta frequency (13–30 Hz) during rest as well as during isometric contraction compared to controls. In healthy control subjects the power of the contralateral hemisphere was significantly suppressed during isometric contraction. By contrast, both hemispheres were activated equally strongly in de novo patients. In medicated patients, the pattern was found to be reversed. Contralateral beta power was significantly correlated with motor impairment during isometric contraction but not during rest. The present results suggest that the reduced ability of the primary motor cortex to disengage from increased beta band oscillations during the execution of movements is an early marker of PD.},

abstract = {Motor neurons are often assumed to generate spikes in proportion to the excitatory synaptic input received. There are, however, many intrinsic properties of motor neurons that might affect this relationship, such as persistent inward currents (PICs), spike-threshold accommodation, or spike-frequency adaptation. These nonlinear properties have been investigated in reduced animal preparation but have not been well studied during natural motor behaviors because of the difficulty in characterizing synaptic input in intact animals. Therefore, we studied the influence of each of these intrinsic properties on spiking responses and muscle force using a population model of motor units that simulates voluntary contractions in human subjects. In particular, we focused on the difference in firing rate of low-threshold motor units when higher threshold motor units were recruited and subsequently derecruited, referred to as DeltaF. Others have used DeltaF to evaluate the extent of PIC activation during voluntary behavior. Our results showed that positive DeltaF values could arise when any one of these nonlinear properties was included in the simulations. Therefore, a positive DeltaF should not be considered as exclusive evidence for PIC activation. Furthermore, by systematically varying contraction duration and speed in our simulations, we identified a means that might be used experimentally to distinguish among PICs, accommodation, and adaptation as contributors to DeltaF.},

@article{Myers2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In investigations of the human motor system, two approaches are generally employed toward the identification of common modulating drives from motor unit recordings. One is a frequency domain method and uses the coherence function to determine the degree of linear correlation between each frequency component of the signals. The other is a time domain method that has been developed to determine the strength of low frequency common modulations between motor unit spike trains, often referred to in the literature as 'common drive'. METHODS: The relationships between these methods are systematically explored using both mathematical and experimental procedures. A mathematical derivation is presented that shows the theoretical relationship between both time and frequency domain techniques. Multiple recordings from concurrent activities of pairs of motor units are studied and linear regressions are performed between time and frequency domain estimates (for different time domain window sizes) to assess their equivalence. RESULTS: Analytically, it may be demonstrated that under the theoretical condition of a narrowband point frequency, the two relations are equivalent. However practical situations deviate from this ideal condition. The correlation between the two techniques varies with time domain moving average window length and for window lengths of 200 ms, 400 ms and 800 ms, the r2 regression statistics (p < 0.05) are 0.56, 0.81 and 0.80 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although theoretically equivalent and experimentally well correlated there are a number of minor discrepancies between the two techniques that are explored. The time domain technique is preferred for short data segments and is better able to quantify the strength of a broad band drive into a single index. The frequency domain measures are more encompassing, providing a complete description of all oscillatory inputs and are better suited to quantifying narrow ranges of descending input into a single index. In general the physiological question at hand should dictate which technique is best suited.},

abstract = {We accurately measured the conductance responsible for the afterhyperpolarization (medium AHP) that follows a single spike in spinal motoneurons of anesthetized cats. This was done by using the dynamic-clamp method. We injected an artificial current in the neurons that increased the AHP amplitude, and we made use of the fact that the intensity of the natural AHP current at the trough of the voltage trajectory was related linearly to the AHP amplitude. We determined at the same time the conductance and the reversal potential of the AHP current. This new method was validated by a simple theoretical model incorporating AHP and hyperpolarization-activated (I-h) currents and could be applied when the decay time constant of the AHP conductance was at least five times shorter than the estimated Ih activation time. This condition was fulfilled in 33 of 44 motoneurons. The AHP conductance varied from 0.3 to 1.4 mu S in both slow- and fast-type motoneurons, which was approximately the same range as the input conductance of the entire population. However, AHP and input conductances were not correlated. The larger AHP in slow-type motoneurons was mainly attributable to their smaller input conductance compared with fast motoneurons. The likeness of the AHP conductance in both types of motoneurons is in sharp contrast to differences in AHP decay time and explains why slow- and fast-type motoneurons have similar gain.},

abstract = {The functional implications of central motor impairment and peripheral muscle alterations in multiple sclerosis are unclear. Muscle strength, central and peripheral activation, and symptomatic fatigue were investigated in 16 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 18 control subjects. Voluntary and electrically stimulated isometric contractions were obtained from the ankle dorsiflexor muscles. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was 27{\{}{\%}{\}} lower in MS patients than controls, although electrically stimulated force was similar. Muscle fat-free cross-sectional area (CSA) was similar in both groups. These data indicate central activation impairment in MS. Such impairment in MS was further demonstrated by decreased foot-tap speed, rate of voluntary force development, and central activation ratio. Peripheral activation changes in MS patients were modest. Although stimulated tetanic force was similar, force relaxation was slower in MS patients compared to controls, resulting in a left-shifted force-frequency relationship in MS. Motor function changes were not associated with fatigue but were associated with impaired ambulation. Thus, weakness and walking impairment, but not fatigue, were related to impaired central activation in MS. These findings may help optimize rehabilitation strategies designed to improve function in persons with MS.},

@article{Fuglevand1993,
abstract = {1. Isometric muscle force and the surface electromyogram (EMG) were simulated from a model that predicted recruitment and firing times in a pool of 120 motor units under different levels of excitatory drive. The EMG-force relationships that emerged from simulations using various schedules of recruitment and rate coding were compared with those observed experimentally to determine which of the modeled schemes were plausible representations of the actual organization in motor-unit pools. 2. The model was comprised of three elements: a motoneuron model, a motor-unit force model, and a model of the surface EMG. Input to the neuron model was an excitatory drive function representing the net synaptic input to motoneurons during voluntary muscle contractions. Recruitment thresholds were assigned such that many motoneurons had low thresholds and relatively few neurons had high thresholds. Motoneuron firing rate increased as a linear function of excitatory drive between recruitment threshold and peak firing rate levels. The sequence of discharge times for each motoneuron was simulated as a random renewal process. 3. Motor-unit twitch force was estimated as an impulse response of a critically damped, second-order system. Twitch amplitudes were assigned according to rank in the recruitment order, and twitch contraction times were inversely related to twitch amplitude. Nonlinear force-firing rate behavior was simulated by varying motor-unit force gain as a function of the instantaneous firing rate and the contraction time of the unit. The total force exerted by the muscle was computed as the sum of the motor-unit forces. 4. Motor-unit action potentials were simulated on the basis of estimates of the number and location of motor-unit muscle fibers and the propagation velocity of the fiber action potentials. The number of fibers innervated by each unit was assumed to be directly proportional to the twitch force. The area of muscle encompassing unit fibers was proportional to the number of fibers innervated, and the location of motor-unit territories were randomly assigned within the muscle cross section. Action-potential propagation velocities were estimated from an inverse function of contraction time. The train of discharge times predicted from the motoneuron model determined the occurrence of each motor-unit action potential. The surface EMG was synthesized as the sum of all motor-unit action-potential trains. 5. Two recruitment conditions were tested: narrow (limit of recruitment <50{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum excitation) and broad recruitment range conditions (limit of recruitment >70{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum excitation). Three rate coding conditions were tested: 1) low-threshold units attained greater firing rates than high-threshold units, 2) all units were assigned the same peak firing rate, and 3) peak firing rates were matched for each unit to the stimulus frequency required for maximum tetanic force. 6. The relation between EMG and force was linear when recruitment operated over a broad force range, and peak firing rates were not the same for all units. When recruitment was complete at low force levels (<57{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum) the EMG-force relation, in all cases, was nonlinear and unlike that observed experimentally. 7. For the conditions that yielded linear EMG-force relationships, the relation between EMG and excitatory drive and between force and excitatory drive were both nonlinear. Because the shape of those nonlinear relationships were similar, when EMG was plotted as a function of force, a linear relation resulted. 8. When recruitment operated over a broad range and the peak firing rates were similar for all motor units, the EMG-force relation exhibited a slightly parabolic shape. As excitatory drive increased and the mean firing rates of the units converged toward the same value, rhythmic bursting was evident in the EMG. The bursting was associated with an augmentation of EMG amplitude, which induced a degree of concavity on an otherwise linear EMG-force relationship. 9. Unexpectedly, the maximum force capacity of the modeled muscle was not achieved in conditions where peak firing rates were set for each unit equivalent to the stimulus rate required for maximum tetanic force. The natural variability in interspike intervals combined with nonlinear force-firing rate curves for each unit diminished force from what would have been exerted had units discharged with constant interspike intervals. 10. The relation between the twitch force of a unit and the muscle force at which the unit was recruited was linear. However, the force added by the recruitment of a new unit was not a constant fraction of the muscle force. The force contributed by newly recruited units, relative to muscle force, declined hyperbolically as muscle force increased. This occurred because low-threshold units generated a larger proportion of their maximum force capacity when discharging at the threshold rate as compared with high-threshold units.},

abstract = {Although balance during quiet standing is postulated to be influenced by multiple factors, including ankle stiffness, it is unclear how different mechanisms underlying increases in stiffness affect balance control. Accordingly, this study examined the influence of muscle activation and passive ankle stiffness increases on the magnitude and frequency of postural sway. Sixteen young adults participated in six quiet stance conditions including: relaxed standing, four muscle active conditions (10{\{}{\%}{\}}, 20{\{}{\%}{\}}, 30{\{}{\%}{\}} and 40{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)), and one passive condition wearing an ankle foot orthotic (AFO). Kinetics were collected from a force plate, while whole-body kinematics were collected with a 12-sensor motion capture system. Bilateral electromyographic signals were recorded from the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles. Quiet stance sway amplitude (range and root mean square) and frequency (mean frequency and velocity) in the sagittal plane were calculated from time-varying centre of gravity (COG) and centre of pressure (COP) data. Compared to the relaxed standing condition, metrics of sway amplitude were significantly increased (between 37.5 and 63.2{\{}{\%}{\}}) at muscle activation levels of 30{\{}{\%}{\}} and 40{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC. Similarly, frequency measures increased between 30.5 and 154.2{\{}{\%}{\}} in the 20-40{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC conditions. In contrast, passive ankle stiffness, induced through the AFO, significantly decreased sway amplitude (by 23-26{\{}{\%}{\}}), decreased COG velocity by 13.8{\{}{\%}{\}}, and increased mean COP frequency by 24.9{\{}{\%}{\}}. These results demonstrate that active co-contraction of ankle musculature (common in Parkinson's Disease patients) may have differential effects on quiet stance balance control compared to the use of an ankle foot orthotic (common for those recovering from stroke).},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of aging on the stretch reflex in the ankle muscles, and in particular to compare the effects on the ankle dorsi-flexor (tibialis anterior: TA) and the plantar-flexor (soleus: SOL). Stretch reflex responses were elicited in the TA and SOL at rest and during weak voluntary contractions in 20 elderly and 23 young volunteers. The results indicated that, in the TA muscle, the elderly group had a remarkably larger long-latency reflex (LLR), whereas no aging effect was found in the short latency reflex (SLR). These results were very different from those in the SOL muscle, which showed significant aging effects in the SLR and medium latency reflex (MLR), but not in the LLR. Given the fact that the LLR of the TA stretch reflex includes the cortical pathway, it is probable that the effects of aging on the TA stretch reflex involve alterations not only at the spinal level but also at the cortical level. The present results indicate that the stretch reflexes of each of the ankle antagonistic muscles are affected differently by aging, which might have relevance to the neural properties of each muscle.},

abstract = {During upright stance, the human body oscillates due to the displacement of the center of mass. These oscillations can be measured with ground force plates as sway patterns of the center of pressure (CoP, point of the resultant ground reaction forces) both in anterior-posterior and in medial-lateral directions (Prieto et al., 1996). The measurement of the CoP sway is very useful to assess the human postural control system. Several mathematical models of the postural control system, which stand for sway measures of humans, have been developed from a control engineering point of view (Kohn, 2007, Masani et al., 2006, Maurer and Peterka, 2005, Peterka, 2000). One of the aspects that has not been completely elucidated is the contribution of passive ankle torque to postural control (Maurer and Peterka, 2005). Moreover, none of the models proposed previously included a force feedback mechanism , which is important in the regulation of muscle activity (Rothwell, 1986). Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a biologically plausible model of the postural control system considering force feedback. In order to evaluate the model, quiet stance was simulated and compared with measured data from able-bodied humans.},

abstract = {Sensory feedback is required by biological motor control systems to maintain stability, respond to perturbations, and adapt. Similarly, motor neuroprostheses require feedback to provide natural and complete restoration of motor functions. In this paper, we show that ensemble firing rates from the body's mechanoreceptors can provide a natural source of kinematic state feedback and could be useful for prosthetic control. Single unit recordings from multiple primary afferent neurons were obtained during walking using multichannel electrode arrays implanted chronically in the L7 dorsal root ganglia of three cats. We typically recorded simultaneously from over 20-30 neurons during the first 7-14 days after surgery, but recordings gradually worsened thereafter. Histology indicates that a ring of inflammatory and connective tissues (100 mu m thick) develops around each microelectrode and likely contributes to the degradation in recording quality. Accurate estimates of the hindlimb trajectory were made using a linear filter with inputs from only a few neurons highly correlated with limb kinematics. The coefficients for the linear filter were identified in a least-squares fit with 5-10 s of walking data (model training stage). The estimated and actual trajectories of separate walking data generally match well for walking at a range of speeds accounting for 63 +/- 22{\%} (mean +/- S.D. for hip, knee, and ankle) of the variance in joint angle and 72 +/- 4 {\%} of the variance in joint angular velocities. These results indicate that a neural interface with primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion can provide accurate kinematic state information that may be useful for closed loop control of a neuroprosthesis.},

@article{Sanderson2006,
abstract = {Several authors have shown different excitation patterns for soleus and gastrocnemius muscles in response to cadence manipulation during cycling. The purpose of this study was to examine gastrocnemius and soleus length and velocity change as a function of pedalling cadence to consider mechanisms underlying these excitation differences. Ten male and two female cyclists rode at five randomly assigned cadences (50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 rpm) at a nominal 200 W power output while EMG of the gastrocnemius and soleus and sagittal plane video were recorded. Joint-coordinate data for the knee and ankle were used with equations of Grieve et al. [Grieve D, Pheasant S, Cavanagh PR. Prediction of gastrocnemius length from knee and ankle joint posture, in: E. Asmussen, K. Jorgensen, editors. International Series on Biomechanics, vol. 2A, Baltimore: University Park Press; 1978. p. 405-412] to compute gastrocnemius and soleus length and velocity. Consistent with previous publications, gastrocnemius displayed a significant (p<0.05) increase in integrated EMG with increased cadence, whereas cadence had no significant effect on integrated EMG of the soleus. The ankle became significantly (p<0.05) more plantar flexed and reflected a reduced range of motion with increased cadence while the knee became significantly (p<0.05) less extended. Soleus decreased its range of motion by 29{\{}{\%}{\}}, whereas gastrocnemius decreased its range of motion by 9{\{}{\%}{\}}. In contrast, soleus increased its velocity range by 32{\{}{\%}{\}} and gastrocnemius increased by 45{\{}{\%}{\}}. These data show that with increased cadence gastrocnemius operated over a narrower range of operating lengths but at a higher range of shortening velocity than soleus. The higher range of velocity may have resulted in the need for a relatively higher excitation, as indicated by the integrated EMG, as the muscle was working at a different range on its force-velocity curve. During the recovery portion of the pedalling cycle, the soleus was acting eccentrically while the gastrocnemius acted concentrically indicating the triceps surae complex did not always act in unison.},

abstract = {We investigated the relationship between local field potential (LFP) oscillations and intrinsic spiking rhythmicity in the sensorimotor system, because intrinsic rhythmicity has the potential to enhance network oscillations. LFPs and 918 single units were recorded from primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1, areas 3a and 2), posterior parietal cortex (area 5) and the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Some cells were antidromically identified as pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). In each area the power of approximately 20 Hz LFP oscillations was assessed during periods of steady holding, when such oscillations have previously been shown to be maximal in M1. Oscillations were strongest in area 5 and weakest in the DCN. Using a previously developed method, the postspike distance-to-threshold trajectory was determined from the interspike interval histogram for each cell. Many cells had significant peaks, suggesting an intrinsic tendency towards rhythmic firing. Surprisingly, trajectory peaks were most common for M1 PTNs (115/146 cells) and rarest for area 5 neurons (12/82 cells). The extent of intrinsic spiking rhythmicity is not therefore simply related to the strength of 20 Hz oscillations in the sensorimotor system. These results suggest that intrinsic rhythmicity is not required for the generation and maintenance of oscillatory activity.},

abstract = {In order to determine the influence of somatosensory impairments, due to the loss of large myelinated fibres, on the postural stability of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT) patients, a cross-sectional balance assessment was done. Nine CMT patients were compared with eight patients with a distal type of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), and 11 healthy control subjects. The balance assessment consisted of four tasks: quiet barefoot standing on a stable versus compliant surface, with eyes opened or closed. Force plate signals were used to calculate the velocity of the centre of pressure of the ground reaction forces. The patients' distal muscle force (MRC scale), vibration detection threshold (Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork) and superficial tactile sensation (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments) were clinically assessed. Compared to the healthy subjects, postural stability of both patient groups was seriously impaired, however, increased visual dependency was only found in the CMT patients. The postural instability of the CMT patients correlated significantly with decreased vibration sense only. The strength of the correlation increased with task complexity. It is concluded that somatosensory deficits substantially contribute to impaired postural stability and increased visual dependency in CMT patients. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Research on unperturbed stance is largely based on a one-segment inverted pendulum model. Recently, an increasing number of studies report a contribution of other major joints to postural control. Therefore this study evaluates whether the conclusions originating from the research based on a one-segment model adequately capture postural sway during unperturbed stance. High-pass filtered kinematic data (cutoff frequency 1/30 Hz) obtained over 3 min of unperturbed stance were analyzed in different ways. Variance of joint angles was analyzed. Principal-component analysis (PCA) was performed on the variance of lower leg, upper leg, and head-arms-trunk (HAT) angles, as well as on lower leg and COM angle (the orientation of the line from ankle joint to center of mass). It was found that the variance in knee and hip joint angles did not differ from the variance found in the ankle angle. The first PCA component indicated that, generally, the upper leg and HAT segments move in the same direction as the lower leg with a somewhat larger amplitude. The first PCA component relating ankle angle variance and COM angle variance indicated that the ankle joint angle displacement gives a good estimate of the COM angle displacement. The second PCA component on the segment angles partly explains the apparent discrepancy between these findings because this component points to a countermovement of the HAT relative to the ankle joint angle. It is concluded that postural control during unperturbed stance should be analyzed in terms of a multiple inverted pendulum model.},

Twenty young and twenty old subjects underwent assessment of isometric maximum voluntary contraction (WC), one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength, and steadiness during isometric, concentric, and eccentric contractions with the knee extensor muscles. The old adults displayed 33{\{}{\%}{\}} lower MVC force and a 41{\{}{\%}{\}} lower 1-RM load. The coefficient of variation for force was significantly greater for the old adults during isometric contractions at 2, 5, and 10{\{}{\%}{\}} of MVC but not at 50{\{}{\%}{\}} WC. The decline in steadiness at low forces experienced by the men was marginally greater than that experienced by the women. The steadiness of concentric and eccentric contractions was similar in young and old adults at 5, 10, and 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of 1-RM load. Old subjects exhibited greater coactivation of an antagonist muscle compared with young subjects during the submaximal isometric and anisometric contractions.

The electromyographic (EMG) signals were decomposed into the individual motor-unit action potential trains comprising the signal. The interaction among motor units were characterized by the estimated time-varying mean firing rate and the cross-correlation between the time-varying mean firing rates of pairs of motor units. Pairs of motor units within each muscle as well as pairs of motor units across the muscles were considered. In-phase common fluctuations, termed common drive, were observed in the mean firing rates of motor units within each muscle, consistent with earlier work on other muscles. Common fluctuations were also observed between the firing rates of ECU and ECRL motor units albeit with a variable phase shift. The existence of common drive across synergistic muscles was interpreted as implying that the CNS considers the muscles as a functional unit when they act as synergists.},

abstract = {Several types of equilibrium point (EP) controllers have been proposed for the control of posture and movement. EP controllers are appealing from a computational perspective because they do not require solving the "inverse dynamic problem" (i.e., computation of the torques required to move a system along a desired trajectory). It has been argued that EP controllers are not capable of controlling fast single-joint movements. To refute this statement, several extensions have been proposed, although these have been tested using models in which only the tendon compliance, force-length-velocity relation, and mechanical interaction between tendon and contractile element were not adequately represented. In the present study, fast elbow-joint movements were measured and an attempt was made to reproduce these using a realistic musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Three types of EP controllers were evaluated: an open-loop alpha-controller, a closed-loop lambda-controller, and a hybrid open- and closed-loop controller. For each controller we considered a continuous version and a version in which the control signals were sent out intermittently. Only the intermittent hybrid EP controller was capable of generating movements that were as fast as those of the subjects. As a result of the nonlinear muscle properties, the hybrid EP controller requires a more detailed representation of static muscle properties than generally assumed in the context of EP control. In sum, this study shows that fast single-joint movements can be realized without explicitly solving the inverse dynamics problem, but in a less straightforward manner than implied by proponents of conventional EP controllers.},

abstract = {There is currently much interest in the synchronisation of neural discharge and the potential role it may play in information coding within the nervous system. We describe some recent results from investigations of synchronisation within the motor system. Local field potentials (LFPs) and identified pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) were recorded from the primary motor cortex of monkeys trained to perform a precision grip task. The LFPs showed bursts of oscillatory activity at 20-30 Hz, which were coherent with the rectified electromyographs (EMG) of contralateral hand and forearm muscles. This oscillatory synchronisation showed a highly specific task dependence, being present only during the part of the task when the animal maintained a steady grip and not during the movement phases before or after it. PTNs were phase-locked to LFP oscillations, implying that at least part of the coherence between cortical activity and EMG was mediated by corticospinal fibres. The phase locking of the PTNs to LFP oscillations produced task-dependent oscillatory synchronisation between PTN pairs, as assessed by the single-unit cross-correlation histogram. Recordings were also made from normal human subjects performing a precision grip similar to that used in the monkey recordings. Pairs of EMGs recorded from intrinsic hand and forearm muscles showed 20-30 Hz coherence, which modulated during task performance, being present only during periods of steady contraction. We suggest that these changes in EMG-EMG synchronisation reflect changing levels of synchronous drive from the corticospinal system. The generation of oscillations in the cortex is discussed in the light of results from a model of local cortical circuits. Other modelling work has shown that synchrony in the corticospinal inputs could act to recruit motoneurones more efficiently, producing more output force from a muscle than asynchronous inputs firing at the same mean rate. A speculative hypothesis is presented on the role of synchronous oscillations in the motor system, which is consistent with experimental observations to date.},

abstract = {The functions of ipsilateral cutaneous reflexes were studied with short trains of stimuli presented pseudorandomly to the superficial peroneal (SP) and tibial nerves during human gait. Electromyograms (EMGs) of tibialis anterior (TA), soleus, lateral and medial gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps femoris (BF) muscle were recorded, together with ankle and knee joint angles. Net reflex EMG responses were quantified in each of the 16 parts of the step cycle according to a recently developed technique. After SP nerve stimulation, TA muscle showed a significant suppression during swing phase that was highly correlated to ankle plantarflexion. BF and VL muscles were both excited throughout swing and significantly correlated to knee flexion during early swing. Tibial nerve stimulation caused dorsiflexion during late stance, but plantarflexion during late swing. We argue that SP nerve reflexes are indicative of a stumbling corrective response to nonnoxious electrical stimulation in humans. The correlated kinematic responses after tibial nerve stimulation may allow smooth movement of the swing leg so as to prevent tripping during swing and to assist placing and weight acceptance at the beginning of stance.},

abstract = {Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) which underlie the plateau potentials are an important intrinsic property of spinal motoneutons. Electrophysiological experiments have indicated that a subtype of the low threshold L-type calcium channel, Ca(V)1.3, mediates this current. In mouse and turtle lumbar spinal cord it has been shown that these channel proteins are mainly found on motoneuron dendrites. In the present study we have used immumohistochemistry to locate these channels in lumbar spinal neurons, especially motoneurons, of the cat. The results indicate that Ca(V)1.3 immunoreactivity was unevenly distributed among the laminae of the spinal grey matter. The small neurons in superficial dorsal horn (laminae I-III) were sparsely and weakly labelled, while large neurons in ventral horn were frequently and densely labelled. Groups of motoneurons in lamina IX that were immunoreactive to choline acetyltransferase also co-expressed Ca(V)1.3. The immmunoreactivity was mainly associated with neuronal somata and proximal dendrites. Double staining with antibodies against Ca(V)1.3 and MAP2 (a dendritic marker) showed that some fine fibres, which may include distal dendrites, were also labelled. These results in the cat spinal cord show some differences from studies in mouse and turtle motoneurons where the immunoreactivity against this channel was mainly localized to the dendrites.

abstract = {Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents are thought to make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha-motoneurons, influencing both the transfer of synaptic current to the soma and the effects of that current on repetitive discharge. Recent studies have paid particular attention to the contribution of L-type calcium channels, which are thought to be widely distributed on both the somatic and the dendritic membrane. However, the relative contribution of different channel subtypes as well as their somatodendritic distribution may vary among motoneurons of different species, developmental stages, and motoneuron pools. In this study, we have characterized persistent inward currents in juvenile (10- to 24-day-old) rat hypoglossal (HG) motoneurons. Whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings were made from the somata of visualized rat HG motoneurons in 300-mum brain stem slices. Slow (10 s), triangular voltage-clamp commands from a holding potential of -70 to 0 mV and back elicited whole-cell currents that were dominated by outward, potassium currents, but often showed a region of negative slope resistance on the rising phase of the command. In the presence of potassium channel blockers (internal cesium and external 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium), net inward currents were present on both the rising and falling phases of the voltage-clamp command. A portion of the inward current present on the ascending phase of the command was mediated by TTX-sensitive sodium channels, whereas calcium channels mediated the remainder of the current. We found roughly the same relative contributions of P-, N-, and L-type channels to the calcium currents recorded at the soma that had previously been found in neonatal rat HG motoneurons. In most cells, the somatic voltage thresholds for calcium current onset and offset were similar and the peak current was largest on the ascending phase of the clamp command. However, about one-third of the cells exhibited a substantial clockwise current hysteresis, i.e., inward currents were present at lower voltages on the descending phase of the clamp command. In the same cells, 1-s depolarizing voltage-clamp commands were followed by prolonged tail currents, consistent with a prominent contribution from dendritic channels. In contrast to previous reports on turtle and mouse motoneurons, blocking L-type calcium channels did not eliminate these presumed dendritic currents.},

abstract = {Compared to complex structural Huxley-type models, Hill-type models phenomenologically describe muscle contraction using only few state variables. The Hill-type models dominate in the ever expanding field of musculoskeletal simulations for simplicity and low computational cost. Reasonable parameters are required to gain insight into mechanics of movement. The two most common Hill-type muscle models used contain three components. The series elastic component is connected in series to the contractile component. A parallel elastic component is either connected in parallel to both the contractile and the series elastic component (model [CC+SEC]), or is connected in parallel only with the contractile component (model [CC]). As soon as at least one of the components exhibits substantial nonlinearities, as, e.g., the contractile component by the ability to turn on and off, the two models are mechanically different. We tested which model ([CC+SEC] or [CC]) represents the cat soleus better. Ramp experiments consisting of an isometric and an isokinetic part were performed with an in situ cat soleus preparation using supramaximal nerve stimulation. Hill-type models containing force-length and force-velocity relationship, excitation-contraction coupling and series and parallel elastic force-elongation relations were fitted to the data. To test which model might represent the muscle better, the obtained parameters were compared with experimentally determined parameters. Determined in situations with negligible passive force, the force-velocity relation and the series elastic component relation are independent of the chosen model. In contrast to model [CC+SEC], these relations predicted by model [CC] were in accordance with experimental relations. In conclusion model [CC] seemed to better represent the cat soleus contraction dynamics and should be preferred in the nonlinear regression of muscle parameters and in musculoskeletal modeling.},

abstract = {The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for conduction block in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) are still unclear. To clarify the physiological abnormalities at the site of the block, we tested the effects induced by polarizing direct currents on motor conduction along forearm nerves in 25 normal nerves (13 subjects), and at the site of conduction block in six nerves (five patients) with MMN. In healthy controls, whereas nerve depolarization failed to change the conditioned compound muscle action potential (CMAP), hyperpolarization elicited a significant, charge-dependent, decrease in the conditioned CMAP size. Hyperpolarization with 4 mC elicited CMAPs that were 86.76 +/- 5.22{\{}{\%}{\}} (mean +/- SEM) of the control unconditioned response (P < 0.05). Analysis of individual MMN nerves showed that polarizing currents elicited markedly heterogeneous effects: depending on the nerve tested, depolarization or hyperpolarization in most cases significantly improved conduction along motor fibres across the conduction block. In three MMN nerves, pathophysiological abnormalities were consistent with a hyperpolarizing block, in two with a depolarizing block, and in one with a mixed block. Our observations indicate that the pathophysiological abnormalities at the site of conduction block in MMN may arise from depolarization or hyperpolarization, probably depending on the course of disease.},

The mean phase lead of the bursts of APs relative to a sinusoidally modulated isometric torque in the elbow joint or relative to sinusoidal movements in the elbow increases gradually with frequency. The increase of the mean phase lead during isometric contractions was very similar for all MUs and could be explained well by modeling the force production of MUs with a second-order linear low-pass system. For sinusoidal flexion/extension movements each MU reveals a specific, reproducible phase lead as a function of frequency. However, there is a large variability in phase behavior between MUs. Also, the modulation of the firing rate for sinusoidal isometric contractions versus sinusoidal movements appeared to be different for various MUs. In simultaneous recordings some MUs clearly revealed a larger firing rate in each burst for movements relative to isometric contractions, whereas other MUs revealed a smaller firing rate. This suggests that some MUs are preferentially activated during movements whereas others are preferably activated during isometric contractions. The results demonstrate task-dependent changes in the relative activation of MUs within a single muscle for sinusoidal isometric contractions and movements.},

Parameter regions where the model displays bistable behavior were computationally determined using genetic algorithms. Two fitness criteria were used to evaluate bistable behavior in the model: one using mathematically based techniques and the other experimentally based techniques. The performance of the GA depended on the fitness measure used but initial results confirm that bistable spiking is robustly generated when spike-generating currents are compartmentally segregated from plateau potential-generating currents with weak coupling conductance between the compartments.

abstract = {Experimental electromyogram (EMG) data from the human biceps brachii were simulated using the model described in [10] of this work, A multichannel linear electrode array, spanning the length of the biceps, was used to detect monopolar and bipolar signals, from which double differential signals were computed, during either voluntary or electrically elicited isometric contractions. For relatively low-level voluntary contractions (10{\%}-30{\%} of maximum force) individual firings of three to four-different motor units mere identified and their waveforms were closely approximated by the model. Motor unit parameters such as depth, size, fiber orientation and length, location of innervation and tendonous zones, propagation velocity, and source width were estimated using the model. Two applications of the model are described. The first analyzes the effects of electrode rotation with respect to the muscle cider direction and shows the possibility of conduction velocity (CV) over- and under-estimation. The second focuses on the myoelectric manifestations of fatigue during a sustained electrically elicited contraction and the interrelationship between muscle fiber CV, spectral and amplitude variables, and the length of the depolarization zone, It is concluded that a) surface EMG detection using an electrode array, when combined with a model of signal propagation, provides a useful method for understanding the physiological and anatomical determinants of EMG waveform characteristics and b) the model provides a way for the interpretation of fatigue plots.},

abstract = {The conventional bipolar surface electromyography (EMG) technique detects, due to its low spatial resolution, the superimposed electromyographic activity of a large number of motor units (MU's). In superficial muscles the isolated action potentials of the most superficial MU's can be recorded noninvasively by means of surface electrodes, if the method of spatial filtering, in connection with electrode arrays, is used, Up to now, only filters with an anisotropic transfer function have been used, As the surface potential distribution generated by the excitation of the MU's contains spatial frequencies in the anisotropic range of those filters, it can be assumed that isotropic spatial filters detect the single MU activity more effectively, In the present study, different isotropic and anisotropic filters have been compared by means of theoretical field simulations and experiments in volunteers, A tripole model for an excited MU was used as the basis for simulating the spatial extension of the filter response for each of the investigated filters, The spatial extension is an indicative of the spatial resolution, For the experimental validation, the total number of single motor units was not directly investigated, but the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has been determined, Therefore, the potential distribution generated on the skin surface during maximum voluntary contraction has been simultaneous spatially filtered with each of the investigated filters, The simulations show that an isotropic spatial filtering procedure reduces the spatial extension of the filter response and improves the spatial resolution of the EMG-recording arrangement in comparison to anisotropic spatial filters up to 30{\%}, In other words, the spatial selectivity of the arrangement is increased, This improvement in the filter performance is more pronounced for MU's located close to the skin surface than for MU's more distantly located, Additionally, this theoretical improvement in selectivity depends on the direction of the excitation spread relative to the filter alignment, However, the investigations also show that isotropic filters offer an advantage, compared to anisotropic filters, only when the investigated MU is located extremely close to the filter input, The results of the simulations can be confirmed by the experimental investigations, An improvement of 11{\%} in the SNR, relative to anisotropic spatial filters, can be established when using an isotropic spatial filter, This experimental improvement in selectivity is less than the theoretical improvement because the experimentally investigated MU's have less portion in the anisotropic range of the filters than the simulated one at best.},

abstract = {In this essay I will sketch some ideas for how to think about models in biology. I will begin by trying to dispel the myth that quantitative modeling is somehow foreign to biology. I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as 'predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

abstract = {Introduction. Among the differents techniques for motor unit number estimation (MUNE) there is the statistical one (Poisson), in which the activation of motor units is carried out by electrical stimulation and the estimation performed by means of a statistical analysis based on the Poisson's distribution. Objectives. The study was undertaken in order to realize an approximation to the MUNE-Poisson technique showing a coprehensible view of its methodology and also to obtain normal results in the extensor digitorum brevis muscle (EDB)from a healthy population. Subjects and methods. One-hundred-fourteen normal volunteers with age ranging from 10 to 88 years were studied using the MUNE software contained in a Viking IV system. Results. The normal subjects were divided into two age groups (10-59 and 60-88years). The EDB MUNE from all them was 184+/-49. Both, the MUNE and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) were significantly lower in the older age group (p<0.0001), showing the MUNE a better correlation with age than CMAP amplitude (-0.5002 and -0.4142, respectively p<0.0001). Conclusion. Statistical MUNE method is an important way for the assessment to the phisiology of the motor unit. The value of MUNE correlates better with the neuromuscular aging process than CMAP amplitude does.},

Decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered averaging was used to collect surface and intramuscular electromyographic signals during isometric dorsiflexions at 25{\%} of maximum voluntary contraction. The mean surface-MU potential size was divided into the maximum M wave to calculate the motor unit number estimate (MUNE). The MUNE was significantly reduced in the old (91) compared to young (150) men, and further reduced in the very old men (59). Despite the smaller MUNE at age 65, strength was not reduced until beyond 80 years. This suggests that age-related MU loss in the TA does not limit function until a critical threshold is reached.},

abstract = {During an upright stance of humans, it is usually assumed that a stiffer ankle joint contributes to stabilize the stance. To show that under certain conditions a stiffer ankle joint can reduce the stability, the frequency responses of the moment and the angle of the ankle joint against external disturbances caused by random horizontal translations of the support surface were evaluated in ten healthy adult subjects by varying the difficulty of the task at four levels. When it was difficult to keep the upright stance, the subject tended to make the ankle joint stiffer. The transfer function relating the external disturbance moment to the ankle joint moment showed a larger gain in the high frequency range (>0.3 Hz) compared with the gains obtained under easier conditions. A simulation analysis based on a simple inverted pendulum model also reproduced this tendency. These results indicate that the stiffer ankle joint and the resulting higher ankle moment for high frequency external disturbances enhance the possibility that the center of pressure exceeds the limit arising from the size of the feet and can make the upright stance unstable.},

First published March 25, 2010; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol. 00807.2009.-The significant decline in motor neuron number after similar to 60 yr of age is accompanied by a remodeling of the neuromuscular system so that average motor unit force increases and the ability of old adults to produce an intended force declines. One possible explanation for the loss of movement precision is that the remodeling increases the difference in recruitment forces between successively recruited motor units in old adults and this augments force variability at motor unit recruitment. The purpose of the study was to compare the forces and discharge characteristics of motor units in a hand muscle of young and old adults at motor unit recruitment and derecruitment. The difference in recruitment force between pairs of motor units did not differ between young (n similar to 54) and old adults (n = 56; P = 0.702). However, old adults had a greater proportion of contractions in which motor units discharged action potentials transiently before discharging continuously during the ramp increase in force (young: 0.32; old: 0.41; P = 0.045). Force variability at motor unit recruitment was greater for old adults compared with young adults (P <= 0.010), but discharge rate and discharge variability did not differ between age groups (P >= 0.729). These results suggest that the difference in force between the recruitment of successive motor units does not differ between age groups, but that motor unit recruitment may be more transient and could contribute to the greater variability in force observed in old adults during graded ramp contractions.},

In response to hyperpolarizing conditioning stimuli, the threshold changes were significantly greater for CIDP patients than for normal controls (n = 49).

abstract = {Komendantov AO, Ascoli GA. Dendritic excitability and neuronal morphology as determinants of synaptic efficacy. J Neurophysiol 101: 1847-1866, 2009. First published January 28, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.01235.2007. The ability to trigger neuronal spiking activity is one of the most important functional characteristics of synaptic inputs and can be quantified as a measure of synaptic efficacy (SE). Using model neurons with both highly simplified and real morphological structures (from a single cylindrical dendrite to a hippocampal granule cell, CA1 pyramidal cell, spinal motoneuron, and retinal ganglion neurons) we found that SE of excitatory inputs decreases with the distance from the soma and active nonlinear properties of the dendrites can counterbalance this global effect of attenuation. This phenomenon is frequency dependent, with a more prominent gain in SE observed at lower levels of background inputoutput neuronal activity. In contrast, there are no significant differences in SE between passive and active dendrites under higher frequencies of background activity. The influence of the nonuniform distribution of active properties on SE is also more prominent at lower background frequencies. In models with real morphologies, the effect of active dendritic conductances becomes more dramatic and inverts the SE relationship between distal and proximal locations. In active dendrites, distal synapses have higher efficacy than that of proximal ones because of arising dendritic spiking in thin branches with high-input resistance. Lower levels of dendritic excitability can make SE independent of the distance from the soma. Although increasing dendritic excitability may boost SE of distal synapses in real neurons, it may actually reduce overall SE. The results are robust with respect to morphological variation and biophysical properties of the model neurons. The model of CA1 pyramidal cell with realistic distributions of dendritic conductances demonstrated important roles of hyperpolarization-activated (h-) current and A-type K+ current in controlling the efficacy of single synaptic inputs and overall SE differently in basal and apical dendrites.},

abstract = {Unlike upper limb muscles, it remains undocumented as to how motor units in the soleus muscle are organised in terms of recruitment range and discharge rates with respect to their recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds. The possible influence of neuromodulation, such as persistent inward currents (PICs) on lower limb motor unit recruitment and discharge rates has also yet to be reported. To address these issues, electromyographic (EMG) activities from the soleus muscle were recorded using selective branched-wire intramuscular electrodes during ramp-and-hold contractions with intensities up to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The multiple single motor unit activities were then derived using a decomposition technique. The onset-offset hysteresis of motor unit discharge, i.e. a difference between recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds, as well as PIC magnitude calculated by a paired motor unit analysis were used to examine the neuromodulatory effects on discharge behaviours, such as minimum firing rate, peak firing rate and degree of increase in firing rate. Forty-two clearly identified motor units from five subjects revealed that soleus motor units are recruited progressively from rest to contraction strengths close to 95{\%} of MVC, with low-threshold motor units discharging action potentials slower at their recruitment and with a lower peak rate than later recruited high-threshold units. This observation is in contrast to the 'onion skin phenomenon' often reported for the upper limb muscles. Based on positive correlations of the peak discharge rates, initial rates and recruitment order of the units with the magnitude of the onset-offset hysteresis and not PIC contribution, we conclude that discharge behaviours among motor units appear to be related to a variation in an intrinsic property other than PICs.},

abstract = {1. The reflex responses to stretch were studied in single motor units and the surface electromyogram in human masseter. 2. Controlled stretches of the isometrically contracting jaw-closing muscles evoked short-latency (10-15 ms) and long-latency (35-70 ms) excitatory reflex responses in the masseter surface electromyogram. 3. The majority (65{\%}) of tonically active masseter motor units were excited in both short- and long-latency phases of the reflex. The timing of the stimulus determined whether the unit discharged in the short- or long-latency phase. If a non-tonically active motor unit was recruited by the stimulus, it invariably discharged in the long-latency phase. 4. Although short-latency responses were strongly time-locked to the stimulus, there was very Little shortening of interspike intervals (ISIs) in this phase of the reflex. The shortening of ISIs was more prominent and prolonged during the long-latency phase, which explains why this phase produces most of the reflex force changes following the stretch. 5. Within pairs of concurrently active motor units there was a tenfold range in the size of the short-latency response to the same stretch. 6. A substantial proportion (35{\%}) of the twenty-two masseter motor units tested had no statistically significant short-latency reflex response. 7. In contrast to other human muscles, there was no functional connection between a population of Ia afferents and some masseter motoneurons. There are two possible explanations for this result. The short-latency, presumably monosynaptic, Ia afferent inputs may not be uniformly distributed to human masseter motoneurons. Alternatively, these inputs may be subject to tonic presynaptic inhibition that is not uniformly distributed throughout the masseter motoneuron pool.},

abstract = {The spectral properties of surface electrodes used for myoelectric signal detection were investigated using both a theoretical and an experimental approach. On the basis of the theoretical model, the single surface electrode was found to act as a low pass filter depending on the electrode diameter (d) and the fiber conduction velocities (CV). Several dips in the power spectrum were also predicted for varying frequencies depending on d and CV. The mathematical expression of the surface electrode filter was highly consistent with previously demonstrated properties of the single fiber power spectrum. An experimental comparison between myoelectric signals from the vastus lateralis muscle recorded using two electrode pairs with different diameters confirmed this low pass filter effect. However, the dip phenomenon was not observed from experimenal data. The practical consequences of the electrode filter effect are discussed with respect to the interpretation of changes in surface myoelectric signal spectrum, particularly when a shift toward the high frequencies is observed.},

The specific peculiarities of the categories (i) source description, (ii) motor unit structure, (iii) volume conduction, (iv) recording configurations and (v) recruitment and firing behaviour are discussed. For a specific goal, not all aspects conceivable have to be part of a model description. Therefore, finally an attempt is made to integrate the 'question level' and the 'model property level' in a matrix providing direction to the development and application of sEMG models with different characteristics and varying complexity. From this overview it appears that the least complex are models describing how the morphological muscle features are reflected in multi-channel EMG measurements. The most challenging questions in terms of model complexity are related to supporting the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to quantify the effect of motor-unit synchronization on the spike-triggered average forces of a population of motor units. Muscle force was simulated by defining mechanical and activation characteristics of the motor units, specifying motor neuron discharge times, and imposing various levels of motor-unit synchronization. The model comprised 120 motor units. Simulations were performed for motor units 5-120 to compare the spike-triggered average responses in the presence and absence of motor-unit synchronization with the motor-unit twitch characteristics defined in the model. To synchronize motor-unit activity, selected motor-unit discharge times were adjusted; this kept the number of action potentials constant across the three levels of synchrony for each motor unit. Because there was some overlap of motor-unit twitches even at minimal discharge rates, the simulations indicated that spike-triggered averaging underestimates the twitch force of all motor units and the contraction time of motor units with contraction times longer than 49 ms. Although motor-unit synchronization increased the estimated twitch force and decreased the estimated contraction time of all motor units, spike-triggered average force changed systematically with the level of synchrony in motor units 59-120 (upper 90{\%} of the range of twitch forces). However, the reduction in contraction time was similar for moderate and high synchrony. In conclusion, spike-triggered averaging appears to provide a biased estimate of the distribution of twitch properties for a population of motor units because twitch fusion causes an underestimation of twitch force for slow units and motor-unit synchronization causes an overestimation of force for fast motor units.},

abstract = {Motoneuron discharge patterns reflect the interaction of synaptic inputs with intrinsic conductances. Recent work has focused on the contribution of conductances mediating persistent inward currents (PICs), which amplify and prolong the effects of synaptic inputs on motoneuron discharge. Certain features of human motor unit discharge are thought to reflect a relatively stereotyped activation of PICs by excitatory synaptic inputs; these features include rate saturation and de-recruitment at a lower level of net excitation than that required for recruitment. However, PIC activation is also influenced by the pattern and spatial distribution of inhibitory inputs that are activated concurrently with excitatory inputs. To estimate the potential contributions of PIC activation and synaptic input patterns to motor unit discharge patterns, we examined the responses of a set of cable motoneuron models to different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The models were first tuned to approximate the current- and voltage-clamp responses of low- and medium-threshold spinal motoneurons studied in decerebrate cats and then driven with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The responses of the models to excitatory inputs reproduced a number of features of human motor unit discharge. However, the pattern of rate modulation was strongly influenced by the temporal and spatial pattern of concurrent inhibitory inputs. Thus, even though PIC activation is likely to exert a strong influence on firing rate modulation, PIC activation in combination with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs can produce a wide variety of motor unit discharge patterns.},

abstract = {Patients with intention tremor due to multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibit an increased reliance on visual feedback in the sensorimotor control of slow goal-directed movements. In the present study, the use of proprioceptive information was investigated in MS patients with intention tremor compared to MS patients without tremor and healthy controls. Tendon vibration was applied to the wrist extensor muscles during a memory-guided slow wrist step-tracking task to investigate the use of muscle spindle afferent information in online movement control. A significant reduction of movement amplitude was induced by tendon vibration in all three groups, but the effect was found to be smaller in MS patients with tremor (28{\{}{\%}{\}}) than in subjects without tremor (50{\{}{\%}{\}}). Vibration also induced an increase of overall tremor amplitude in the MS tremor group; however, its effect on movement amplitude was not directly related to (changes in) tremor severity. The results suggest that the decreased online use of proprioceptive information in MS patients with tremor reflects an adaptation over time to cope with a tremor-related noisy background. Abnormalities in proprioceptive processing may explain why MS patients with tremor show an increased reliance on visual feedback for online motor control.},

These are rigid robotic exoskeletal structures that typically operate alongside human limbs. Scientific and technological work on exoskeletons began in the early 1960s but have only recently been applied to rehabilitation and functional substitution in patients suffering from motor disorders. Key topics for further development of exoskeletons in rehabilitation scenarios include the need for robust human-robot multimodal cognitive interaction, safe and dependable physical interaction, true wearability and portability, and user aspects such as acceptance and usability. This discussion provides an overview of these aspects and draws conclusions regarding potential future research directions in robotic exoskeletons.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that the direct connection from the motor cortex to spinal motor neurons is responsible for dexterous hand movements in primates. However, the role of the 'phylogenetically older' indirect pathways from the motor cortex to motor neurons, mediated by spinal interneurons, remains elusive. Here we used a novel double-infection technique to interrupt the transmission through the propriospinal neurons (PNs), which act as a relay of the indirect pathway in macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata and Macaca mulatta). The PNs were double infected by injection of a highly efficient retrograde gene-transfer vector into their target area and subsequent injection of adeno-associated viral vector at the location of cell somata. This method enabled reversible expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tetanus neurotoxin, thereby permitting the selective and temporal blockade of the motor cortex-PN-motor neuron pathway. This treatment impaired reach and grasp movements, revealing a critical role for the PN-mediated pathway in the control of hand dexterity. Anti-GFP immunohistochemistry visualized the cell bodies and axonal trajectories of the blocked PNs, which confirmed their anatomical connection to motor neurons. This pathway-selective and reversible technique for blocking neural transmission does not depend on cell-specific promoters or transgenic techniques, and is a new and powerful tool for functional dissection in system-level neuroscience studies.},

abstract = {Little is known about how human motor units respond to chronic paralysis. Our aim was to record surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, twitch forces, and tetanic forces from paralyzed motor units in the thenar muscles of individuals (n=12) with chronic (1.5-19 yr) cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Each motor unit was activated by intraneural stimulation of its motor axon using single pulses and trains of pulses at frequencies between 5 and 100 Hz. Paralyzed motor units (n=48) had small EMGs and weak tetanic forces (n=32 units) but strong twitch forces, resulting in half-maximal force being achieved at a median of only 8 Hz. The distributions for cumulative twitch and tetanic forces also separated less for paralyzed units than for control units, indicating that increases in stimulation frequency made a smaller relative contribution to the total force output in paralyzed muscles. Paralysis also induced slowing of conduction velocities, twitch contraction times and EMG durations. However, the elevated ratios between the twitch and the tetanic forces, but not contractile speed, correlated significantly with the extent to which unit force summated in response to different frequencies of stimulation. Despite changes in the absolute values of many electrical and mechanical properties of paralyzed motor units, most of the distributions shifted uniformly relative to those of thenar units obtained from control subjects. Thus human thenar muscles paralyzed by SCI retain a population of motor units with heterogeneous contractile properties because chronic paralysis influenced all of the motor units similarly.},

The results demonstrate that there was significant coherence between bilateral plantarflexors and within plantarflexors in one leg in the 0- to 4-Hz frequency region in all three age groups. Coherence in this frequency region was stronger in the elderly group than in the adult group, while no difference was found between the adult and child groups. Of particular interest was the finding of significant coherence in bilateral and unilateral EMG recordings in the 8- to 12-Hz frequency region in some subjects in the elderly group, whereas it was not observed in the adult and child groups. These results suggest that aging affects the organization of bilateral and unilateral postural muscle activities (i.e., bilateral and unilateral comodulation) in the plantarflexors during quiet standing.},

We focused on changes in common input to bilateral motor unit pools as evident in surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings of lower leg extensor and flexor muscles. The extensor muscles exhibited bilateral synchronization in two distinct frequency bands (i.e., 0-5 and 10-15 Hz), whereas synchronization between flexor muscles was minimal. As expected, alcohol ingestion affected postural sway, yielding increased sway at higher blood-alcohol levels. Whereas vision affected bilateral synchronization only at 0-5 Hz, alcohol ingestion resulted in a progressive decrease of synchronization at 10-15 Hz between the EMG activities of the extensor muscles. The decrease in common bilateral input is most likely related to reduced reticulospinal activity with alcohol ingestion.},

We propose a model that complies with a well established macroscopic behavior of striated muscles where force-length, force-velocity, and Mirsky-Parmley properties are taken into account. These properties are introduced at the microscopic scale and related to a tentative explanation of the phenomena. The method used integrates behavior ranging from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, and allows the computation of the dynamics of the output force and stiffness controlled by EMG or stimulation parameters. The model can thus be used to simulate and carry out research to develop control strategies using electrical stimulation in the context of rehabilitation. Finally, through animal experiments, we estimated model parameters using a Sigma Point Kalman Filtering technique and dedicated experimental protocols in isometric conditions and demonstrated that the model can accurately simulate individual variations and thus take into account subject dependent behavior.},

abstract = {The treatment of acute and chronic liver failure is still a challenge despite modern therapeutic innovations. While liver transplantation can restore liver function and improve patient survival, donor shortages limit this treatment to a small number of patients. Cellular xenotransplantation has emerged as an alternative for treating liver failure. Xenohepatocytes could be readily available in sufficient quantities to treat patients in critical condition and thereby reduce the donor shortage. The use of isolated encapsulated or non-encapsulated cells can reduce the immunorejection response. Several studies using animal models of acute or chronic liver failure have demonstrated improved survival and recovery of liver function after xenotransplantation of adult hepatocytes. Porcine liver cells are a potential source of xenohepatocytes due to similarities with human physiology and the great number of hepatocytes that can be obtained. The recent development of less immunogenic transgenic pigs, new immunosuppressive drugs, and cellular encapsulation systems represents important advances in the field of cellular xenotransplantation. In this study, we review the work carried out in animal models that deals with the advantages and limitations of hepatocyte xenotransplantation, and we propose new studies needed in this field.},

abstract = {Spinal Wistar Hannover rats trained to step bipedally on a treadmill with manual assistance of the hindlimbs have been shown to improve their stepping ability. Given the improvement in motor performance with practice and the ability of the spinal cord circuitry to learn to step more effectively when the mode of training allows variability, we examined why this intrinsic variability is an important factor. Intramuscular EMG electrodes were implanted to monitor and compare the patterns of activation of flexor (tibialis anterior) and extensor (soleus) muscles associated with a fixed-trajectory and assist-as-needed (AAN) step training paradigms in rats after a complete midthoracic (T8-T9) spinal cord transection. Both methods involved a robotic arm attached to each ankle of the rat to provide guidance during stepping. The fixed trajectory allowed little variance between steps, and the AAN provided guidance only when the ankle deviated a specified distance from the programmed trajectory. We hypothesized that an AAN paradigm would impose fewer disruptions of the control strategies intrinsic to the spinal locomotor circuitry compared with a fixed trajectory. Intrathecal injections of quipazine were given to each rat to facilitate stepping. Analysis confirmed that there were more corrections within a fixed-trajectory step cycle and consequently there was less coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles during the AAN paradigm. These data suggest that some critical level of variation in the specific circuitry activated and the resulting kinematics reflect a fundamental feature of the neural control mechanisms even in a highly repetitive motor task.},

@article{Gawthrop2013,
abstract = {There are two issues in balancing a stick pivoting on a finger tip (or mechanically on a moving cart): maintaining the stick angle near to vertical and maintaining the horizontal position within the bounds of reach or cart track. The (linearised) dynamics of the angle are second order (although driven by pivot acceleration), and so, as in human standing, control of the angle is not, by itself very difficult. However, once the angle is under control, the position dynamics are, in general, fourth order. This makes control quite difficult for humans (and even an engineering control system requires careful design). Recently, three of the authors have experimentally demonstrated that humans control the stick angle in a special way: the closed-loop inverted pendulum behaves as a non-inverted pendulum with a virtual pivot somewhere between the stick centre and tip and with increased gravity. Moreover, they suggest that the virtual pivot lies at the radius of gyration (about the mass centre) above the mass centre. This paper gives a continuous-time control-theoretical interpretation of the virtual-pendulum approach. In particular, by using a novel cascade control structure, it is shown that the horizontal control of the virtual pivot becomes a second-order problem which is much easier to solve than the generic fourth-order problem. Hence, the use of the virtual pivot approach allows the control problem to be perceived by the subject as two separate second-order problems rather than a single fourth-order problem, and the control problem is therefore simplified. The theoretical predictions are verified using the data previously presented by three of the authors and analysed using a standard parameter estimation method. The experimental data indicate that although all subjects adopt the virtual pivot approach, the less expert subjects exhibit larger amplitude angular motion and poorly controlled translational motion. It is known that human control systems are delayed and intermittent, and therefore, the continuous-time strategy cannot be correct. However, the model of intermittent control used in this paper is based on the virtual pivot continuous-time control scheme, handles time delays and moreover masquerades as the underlying continuous-time controller. In addition, the event-driven properties of intermittent control can explain experimentally observed variability.},

abstract = {A silver impregnation method and a morphometric approach were used to define differences existing in the motor nerve terminal branching pattern between a fast-twitch muscle (extensor digitorum longus) and a slow-twitch one (soleus) of the normal adult rat. Because no single measure can describe precisely all geometrical properties (ie both topology and metrics) of the nerve terminals, we evaluated morphologic parameters defining length and angular characteristics in the different terminal segments classified according to their centrifugal order. The main results indicate that the distal free-end segments in the extensor digitorum longus muscle are shorter and less divergent than in the soleus nerve terminals. The endings in the two muscles have different fractal dimensions. Findings are discussed in the context of the hypothetical mechanisms governing motor nerve terminal size and complexity.},

@article{Patino2008,
abstract = {Recently, we studied corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in a visuomotor task and showed for the first time gamma-range (30-45 Hz) CMC during isometric compensation of a periodically modulated dynamic force. We speculated that for the control of such forces, the sensorimotor system resonates at gamma-range frequencies to rapidly integrate the visual and proprioceptive information and produce the appropriate motor command. In this study, we tested the role of the proprioceptive afferent feedback on gamma-range CMC by comparing the deafferented patient GL to six age- and sex-matched subjects during the performance of a visuomotor force task consisting of isometric compensation of static and dynamic forces applied on the finger. Patient GL presented no significant gamma-band CMC during dynamic force. Instead, she had only beta-range CMC as in the static force condition; concurrently, her performance was significantly worse than that of the controls in both conditions. This gives support to the conclusions of our previous paper and suggests that proprioceptive information is mandatory in the genesis of gamma-band CMC during the generation and control of dynamic forces.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the membrane properties (potentials and axonal excitability indices) in the case of myelin wrap reduction (96{\{}{\%}{\}}) in one, two and three consecutive internodes along the length of human motor nerve fibre. The internodally focally demyelinated cases (termed as IFD1, IFD2 and IFD3, respectively, with one, two and three demyelinated internodes are simulated using our previous double cable model of the fibre. The progressively greater increase of focal loss of myelin lamellae blocks the invasion of the intracellular potentials into the demyelinated zones. For all investigated cases, the radial decline of the extracellular potential amplitudes increases with the increase of the radial distance and demyelination, whereas the electrotonic potentials show a decrease in the slow part of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses. The time constants are shorter and the rheobases higher for the IFD2 and IFD3 cases than for the normal case. In the recovery cycles, the same cases have less refractoriness, greater supernormality and less late subnormality than the normal case. The simulated membrane abnormalities can be observed in vivo in patients with demyelinating forms of Guillain-Barr{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} syndrome. The study provides new information about the pathophysiology of acquired demyelinating neuropathies.},

abstract = {Electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded using intramuscular electrodes at six different sites in the brachioradialis muscles during voluntary isometric contractions in four subjects. The potential waveforms and discharge patterns of up to 12 simultaneously active motor units were identified from each signal using computer-aided decomposition. Out of a total of 301 motor unit potentials identified, 23 potentials exhibited behaviour consistent with having been generated by muscle fibres that were innervated by two different motoneurons at widely separated endplates. These potentials discharged in association with two different motor units, but were blocked or delayed whenever the two motor units discharged within a few milliseconds of one another. The blocking was consistent with a collision or refractoriness when one motoneuron tried to excite the fibre while it was already conducting an action potential initiated by the other motoneuron. The delays were consistent with decreased conduction velocity associated with incomplete recovery of the fibre after a preceding action potential. From the temporal separation between the discharges of the two motoneurons that resulted in blocking, the spatial separation between the endplates was estimated to be between 26 and 44 mm. These findings challenge the classical concept of the motor unit as an anatomically distinct and functionally independent entity. It is suggested that the human brachioradialis muscle may contain both long, polyneuronally innervated fibres and short, serially linked, singly innervated fibres.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide evidence on the fact that the observed decrease in EMG activity of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) at pronounced knee flexed positions is not only due to GM insufficiency, by examining muscle fascicle lengths during maximal voluntary contractions at different positions. Twenty-two male long distance runners (body mass: 78.5 +/- 6.7kg, height: 183 +/- 6cm) participated in the study. The subjects performed isometric maximal voluntary plantar flexion contractions (MVQ of their left leg at six ankle-knee angle combinations. To examine the resultant ankle joint moments the kinematics of the left leg were recorded using a Vicon 624 system with 8 cameras operating at 120 Hz. The EMG activity of GM, gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) were measured using surface electromyography. Synchronously, fascicle length and pennation angle values of the GM were obtained at rest and at the plateau of the maximal plantar flexion using ultrasonography. The main findings were: (a) identifiable differences in fascicle length of the GM at rest do not necessarily imply that these differences would also exist during a maximal isometric plantar flexion contraction and (b) the EMG activity of the biarticular GM during the MVC decreased at a pronounced flexed knee-joint position (up to 110 degrees) despite of no differences in GM fascicle length. It is suggested that the decrease in EMG activity of the GM at pronounced knee flexed positions is due to a critical force-length potential of all three muscles of the triceps surae.

abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} syndrome (GBS) is an acute, post-infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune peripheral neuropathy with a highly diverse clinical course and outcome. We classified GBS on the basis of patients' first nerve conduction and validated this system to be associated with outcome on the basis of electrophysiological characteristics during the acute phase of GBS. We retrospectively evaluated 40 GBS patients who underwent their first electrophysiological study within 14 days of onset and classified GBS into four patterns: (1) acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) pattern with sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor-sensory AIDP: MS-AIDP), (2) AIDP pattern without sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor AIDP: M-AIDP), (3) acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) pattern, and (4) minor abnormalities pattern. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory findings between groups and determined subgroups associated with poor outcome. The MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns more frequently exhibited prolonged recovery compared with the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns and were associated with prolonged recovery (specificity, 100 {\{}{\%}{\}}; sensitivity, 73 {\{}{\%}{\}}; P < 0.001). The period of inability to walk independently was significantly longer in the MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns than in the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns (median 85 vs. 10 days; P < 0.001). In conclusion, our classification of GBS using a single nerve conduction study in the early phase of disease is associated with outcomes. This classification can be used to counsel individual patients and guide decision-making with respect to treatment.},

The dynamic stiffness transfer functions relating ankle angular position to ankle torque were calculated. Stiffness gain was flat at low frequencies, had a resonant valley at intermediate frequencies and rose at about 40 dB/decade at high frequencies. The low frequency gain and resonant frequency increased progressively with increases in tonic muscular activity. The dynamic stiffness of the ankle was well described by a linear, under-damped, second-order transfer function having inertial, viscous and elastic terms. Estimates of the inertial parameter were independent of the level of muscle activity whereas the viscous and elastic parameters increased with increases in mean torque level.},

@article{Merlet2013,
abstract = {Both biophysical and neurophysiological aspects need to be considered to assess the impact of electric fields induced by transcranial current stimulation (tCS) on the cerebral cortex and the subsequent effects occurring on scalp EEG. The objective of this work was to elaborate a global model allowing for the simulation of scalp EEG signals under tCS. In our integrated modeling approach, realistic meshes of the head tissues and of the stimulation electrodes were first built to map the generated electric field distribution on the cortical surface. Secondly, source activities at various cortical macro-regions were generated by means of a computational model of neuronal populations. The model parameters were adjusted so that populations generated an oscillating activity around 10 Hz resembling typical EEG alpha activity. In order to account for tCS effects and following current biophysical models, the calculated component of the electric field normal to the cortex was used to locally influence the activity of neuronal populations. Lastly, EEG under both spontaneous and tACS-stimulated (transcranial sinunoidal tCS from 4 to 16 Hz) brain activity was simulated at the level of scalp electrodes by solving the forward problem in the aforementioned realistic head model. Under the 10 Hz-tACS condition, a significant increase in alpha power occurred in simulated scalp EEG signals as compared to the no-stimulation condition. This increase involved most channels bilaterally, was more pronounced on posterior electrodes and was only significant for tACS frequencies from 8 to 12 Hz. The immediate effects of tACS in the model agreed with the post-tACS results previously reported in real subjects. Moreover, additional information was also brought by the model at other electrode positions or stimulation frequency. This suggests that our modeling approach can be used to compare, interpret and predict changes occurring on EEG with respect to parameters used in specific stimulation configurations.},

abstract = {This study modeled ankle angle changes during small forward perturbations of a standing platform. A two-dimensional biomechanical inverted pendulum model was developed that uses sway frequencies derived from quiet standing observations on a subject's Anterior Posterior Center of Pressure (APCoP) to track ankle angle changes during a 16 mm anterior displacement perturbation of a platform on which a subject stood. This model used the total torque generated at the ankle joint as one of the inputs, and calculated it assuming a PID controller. This feedback system generated a simulated ankle torque based on the angular position of the center of mass (CoM) with respect to vertical line passing through the ankle joint. This study also assumed that the internal components of the net torque were only a controller torque and a sway-pattern-generating torque. The final inputs to the model were the platform acceleration and anthropometric terms. This model of postural sway dynamics predicted sway angle and the trajectory of the center of mass. Knowing these relationships can advance an understanding of the ankle strategy employed in balance control.},

Motoneurons share the same general function: they drive the contraction of muscle fibers and are the final common pathway, i.e., the seat of convergence of all the central and peripheral pathways involved in motricity. However, motoneurons innervate different types of muscular targets. Ordinary muscle fibers are subdivided into three main subtypes according to their structural and mechanical properties. Intrafusal muscle fibers located within spindles can elicit either a dynamic, or a static, action on the spindle sensory endings. No less than seven categories of motoneurons have thereby been identified on the basis of their innervation pattern. This functional diversity has hinted at a similar diversity in the inputs each motoneuron receives, as well as in the electrical, or cellular, properties of the motoneurons that match the properties of their muscle targets. The notion of the diverse properties of motoneurons has been well established by the work of many prominent neuroscientists. But in today's scientific literature, it tends to fade and motoneurons are often thought of as a homogenous group, which develop from a given population of precursor cells, and which express a common set of molecules. We first present here the historical milestones that led to the recognition of the functional diversity of motoneurons. We then review how the intrinsic electrical properties of motoneurons are precisely tuned in each category of motoneurons in order to produce an output that is adapted to the contractile properties of their specific targets.},

abstract = {The present study investigates the coding of positions reached in a two-dimensional space by populations of muscle spindle afferents. The unitary activity of 35 primary muscle spindle afferents originating from the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and peroneus lateralis muscles were recorded from the common peroneal nerve by the microneurographic technique. The steady mean frequency of discharge was analyzed during 16 passively maintained positions of the tip of the foot. These positions were equally distant from and circularly arranged around the "neutral" position of the ankle. The results showed that a same position of the foot was differently coded depending on whether it was maintained for several seconds or whether it was attained after a movement. Muscle spindle activity was increased or decreased, respectively, when the previous movement lengthened or shortened the parent muscle; the magnitude of change in activity depended on the amount of lengthening or shortening in relation to movement direction. Each muscle surrounding the ankle joint was shown to encode the different spatial positions following a directional tuning curve. Data were analyzed by using the "neuronal population vector model". This model consists of calculating population vectors representing the mean contribution of each muscle population of afferents to the coding of a particular position, and by finally calculating a sum vector. The direction of the sum vector was shown to accurately describe the direction of a given maintained position compared to the initial position. We conclude that muscle spindle position coding is based on afferent information coming from the whole set of muscles crossing a given joint. A given spatial position is associated with a stable muscle afferent inflow where each muscle makes an oriented and weighted contribution to its coding.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to quantify how fascicle length and velocity modify force production in cat soleus. A computerized muscle puller controlled the length and velocity of the whole-muscle. We recorded the force output at the tendon and the length of muscle fascicles using sonomicrometry during whole-muscle isometric and isokinetic contractions. Peak muscle stress was estimated as 31.8 +/- 4.1 N cm(-2) (mean and SD) and optimal fascicle length, L(0), was estimated as 3.8 +/- 0.6 cm which corresponds to an optimal sarcomere length of 2.49 +/- 0.08 mu m. The isometric force-length data followed closely the expected force-length relationship for cat sarcomeres. The force-velocity relationship was found to be similar in shape between cats, but the per cent increment of force over isometric levels for lengthening contractions was highly variable. Estimates of the kinematics of the fascicles based on whole-muscle length were systematically incorrect; whole-muscle velocity was 21{\%} greater than fascicle velocity. The force-velocity data demonstrated consistent dependencies on fascicle length. At lengths below 0.7 L(0) (1.74 mu m), the shape of the force-velocity relationship was altered by the inclusion of a passive, repulsive force in the estimate of active isometric force. The shape of the force-velocity relationship changed at lengths greater than 0.7 L(0), but was restricted to lengthening velocities where the increment of force with respect to isometric levels was found to increase with fascicle length. This change in shape in the force-velocity relationship for lengthening contractions reveals a systematic, but previously unknown interdependence between fascicle length and velocity on muscle force production.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the relation between linear transformations of motor unit discharge rates and muscle force. Intramuscular (wire electrodes) and high-density surface EMG (13 x 5 electrode grid) were recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle of eight healthy men during 60 s contractions at 5{\%}, 7.5{\%} and 10{\%} of the maximal force. Spike trains of a total of 222 motor units were identified from the EMG recordings with decomposition algorithms. Principal component analysis of the smoothed motor unit discharge rates indicated that one component (first common component, FCC) described 44.2 +/- 7.5{\%} of the total variability of the smoothed discharge rates when computed over the entire contraction interval and 64.3 +/- 10.2{\%} of the variability when computed over 5 s intervals. When the FCC was computed from four or more motor units per contraction, it correlated with the force produced by the muscle (62.7 +/- 10.1{\%}) by a greater degree (P < 0.001) than the smoothed discharge rates of individual motor units (41.4 +/- 7.8{\%}). The correlation between FCC and the force signal increased up to 71.8 +/- 13.1{\%} when the duration and the shape of the smoothing window for discharge rates were similar to the average motor unit twitch force. Moreover, the coefficients of variation (CoV) for the force and for the FCC signal were correlated in all subjects (R2 range = 0.14-0.56; P < 0.05) whereas the CoV for force was correlated to the interspike interval variability in only one subject (R2 = 0.12; P < 0.05). Similar results were further obtained from measures on the tibialis anterior muscle of an additional eight subjects during contractions at forces up to 20{\%} of the maximal force (e.g. FCC explained 59.8 +/- 11.0{\%} of variability of the smoothed discharge rates). In conclusion, one signal captures most of the underlying variability of the low-frequency components of motor unit discharge rates and explains large part of the fluctuations in the motor output during isometric contractions.},

abstract = {Myoelectric signals measured using intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) in animals have shown that faster motor units generate higher frequencies in their power spectra. However, evidence to relate myoelectric frequency and motor unit type from the surface electromyograms typically measured from man have remained elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if spectral properties from surface EMG could be related to the different motor units in the muscles of the leg extensors in man. Reflex experiments (both tendon tap and electrically stimulated) and graded isometric contractions were used to generate muscle contractions with different patterns of motor unit recruitment. EMG was recorded from the vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris, medial and lateral gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. The EMGs were resolved into their intensities in time-frequency space using wavelet techniques. The intensity spectra were calculated for the reflex responses and for different contractile forces. The spectra were compared using principle component analyses and ANCOVA. Electrical stimulation can result in preferentially faster motor units being recruited, and in this study resulted in higher myoelectric frequencies than for the stretch reflex. During ramped contractions the motor units are recruited in an orderly fashion from slow to fast. As the faster motor units were recruited then higher frequency components appeared within the myoelectric intensity spectra. For all muscles tested there were significant correlations between the stage in contraction and the EMG frequency. Both approaches demonstrated higher frequency components in the myoelectric spectra when the faster motor units could be assumed to be active.},

abstract = {Here we have identified a sensorimotor transformation that is used by a mammalian nervous system to produce a multijoint motor behavior. Using a simple biomechanical model, a delayed-feedback rule based on an optimal tradeoff between postural error and neural effort explained patterns of muscle activation in response to a sudden loss of balance in cats. Following the loss of large sensory afferents, changes in these muscle-activation patterns reflected an optimal reweighting of sensory feedback gains to minimize postural instability. Specifically, a loss of center-of-mass-acceleration information, which allowed for a rapid initial rise in the muscle activity in intact animals, was absent after large-fiber sensory neuropathy. Our results demonstrate that a simple and flexible neural feedback control strategy coordinates multiple muscles over time via a small set of extrinsic, task-level variables during complex multijoint natural movements.},

abstract = {1. We studied quiet stance investigating strategies for maintaining balance. Normal subjects stood with natural stance and with feet together, with eyes open or closed. Kinematic, kinetic and EMG data were evaluated and cross-correlated. 2. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a high, positive, zero-phased correlation between anteroposterior motions of the centre of gravity (COG) and centre of pressure (COP), head and COG, and between linear motions of the shoulder and knee in both sagittal and frontal planes. There was a moderate, negative, zero-phased correlation between the anteroposterior motion of COP and ankle angular motion. 3. Narrow stance width increased ankle angular motion, hip angular motion, mediolateral sway of the COG, and the correlation between linear motions of the shoulder and knee in the frontal plane. Correlations between COG and COP and linear motions of the shoulder and knee in the sagittal plane were decreased. The correlation between the hip angular sway in the sagittal and frontal planes was dependent on interaction between support and vision. 4. Low, significant positive correlations with time lags of the maximum of cross-correlation of 250-300 ms were found between the EMG activity of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle and anteroposterior motions of the COG and COP during normal stance. Narrow stance width decreased both correlations whereas absence of vision increased the correlation with COP. 5. Ankle mechanisms dominate during normal stance especially in the sagittal plane. Narrow stance width decreased the role of the ankle and increased the role of hip mechanisms in the sagittal plane, while in the frontal plane both increased. 6. The modulation pattern of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle suggests a central program of control of the ankle joint stiffness working to predict the loading pattern.},

abstract = {One fundamental problem when trying to calculate the force developed by one muscle during a motor task is the muscle model. Usually, one control signal is juxtaposed to one musclotendon unit. The question is how is this signal connected to the activation of the motor units (MUs) that compose the muscle and fire differently. The aim of the paper is to compare a Hill-type muscle model to a model composed of MUs. A fast elbow flexion performed by only one muscle is considered. The activation necessary for performing the motion and the corresponding frequencies are calculated for cases of fast and slow muscles using Hill-type model. Then the muscle is modelled as a mixture of 774 MUs with uniformly distributed twitch parameters. Using MotCo software the moments of impulsation of all MUs and their mechanical responses are predicted. The activation characteristics obtained by the two muscle models are compared. It is concluded that there are two essential parameters for proper muscle modelling: the lead-time and the MUs composition. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A paradox regarding the classic power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is whether the characteristic high- (HF) and low-frequency (LF) spectral peaks represent stochastic or chaotic phenomena. Resolution of this fundamental issue is key to unraveling the mechanisms of HRV, which is critical to its proper use as a noninvasive marker for cardiac mortality risk assessment and stratification in congestive heart failure (CHF) and other cardiac dysfunctions. However, conventional techniques of nonlinear time series analysis generally lack sufficient sensitivity, specificity and robustness to discriminate chaos from random noise, much less quantify the chaos level. Here, we apply a 'litmus test' for heartbeat chaos based on a novel noise titration assay which affords a robust, specific, time-resolved and quantitative measure of the relative chaos level. Noise titration of running short-segment Holter tachograms from healthy subjects revealed circadian-dependent (or sleep/wake-dependent) heartbeat chaos that was linked to the HF component (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The relative 'HF chaos' levels were similar in young and elderly subjects despite proportional age-related decreases in HF and LF power. In contrast, the near-regular heartbeat in CHF patients was primarily nonchaotic except punctuated by undetected ectopic beats and other abnormal beats, causing transient chaos. Such profound circadian-, age- and CHF-dependent changes in the chaotic and spectral characteristics of HRV were accompanied by little changes in approximate entropy, a measure of signal irregularity. The salient chaotic signatures of HRV in these subject groups reveal distinct autonomic, cardiac, respiratory and circadian/sleep-wake mechanisms that distinguish health and aging from CHF.},

abstract = {During voluntary activity in humans, motor units are exposed to a number of descending drives that tend to synchronise motor unit activity at particular frequencies. In particular, the contralateral motor cortex drives muscle discharge in the beta (15-30 Hz) and Piper (30-60 Hz) bands. The cortical activity in these bands is task-specific, somatopicly distributed and generally precedes muscle discharge by an interval appropriate for conduction in fast pyramidal pathways. Coherence between cortex and muscle in the beta band is found during isometric contractions of weak to moderate strength. Thus oscillations within the beta band seem to coincide with a stable, relatively immutable state - a free running mode of the motor cortex that may maintain stable motor output with a minimum of computational effort. In contrast, coherence between cortex and muscle in the Piper band is most evident during strong isometric contractions or during movement. Demands on the motor cortex are likely to be greater and more mutable under these circumstances. Synchronisation in the gamma band may provide a means of binding together those particular, often spatially distributed, cortical elements involved in movement execution under conditions that vary from moment to moment and require some attention. Mechanisms both intrinsic and extrinsic to the cortex determine the pattern of rhythmic cortical activity. The basal ganglia have a pivotal role in this regard, and inadequate output from these nuclei leads to a disappearance of the beta and Piper drives to muscle. This may in turn contribute to slowness and weakness in Parkinson's disease. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological experiments and modeling studies have shown that afterhyperpolarization regulates the discharge of lumbar motoneurons in anesthetized cats and is an important determinant of their firing properties. However, it is still unclear how firing properties depend on slow afterhyperpolarization, input conductance, and the fast currents responsible for spike generation. We study a single-compartment integrate-and-fire model with a slow potassium conductance that exponentially decays between spikes. We show that this model is analytically solvable, and we investigate how passive and active membrane properties control the discharge. We show that the model exhibits three distinct firing ranges (primary, secondary, and high frequency), and we explain the origin of these three ranges. Explicit expressions are established for the gain of the steady-state current-frequency (I - f) curve in the primary range and for the gain of the I- f curve for the first interspike interval. They show how the gain is controlled by the maximal conductance and the kinetic parameters of the afterhyperpolarization conductance. The gain also depends on the spike voltage threshold, and we compute how it is decreased by threshold accommodation (i.e., the increase of the threshold with the injected current). In contrast, the gain is not very sensitive to the input conductance. This implies that tonic synaptic activity shifts the current-frequency curve in its primary range, in agreement with experiments. Taking into account the absolute refractory period associated with spikes somewhat reduces the gain in the primary range. More importantly, it accounts for the approximately linear and steep secondary range observed in many motoneurons. In the nonphysiological high-frequency range, the behavior of the I- f curve is determined by the fast voltage-dependent currents, via the amplitude of the fast repolarization afterspike, the duration of the refractory period, and voltage threshold accommodation, if present.},

At the temperature of 37 degrees C, axons of different diameters (2-20 microm) can be blocked completely at supra-threshold intensities when the stimulation frequency is above 10 kHz. However, at stimulation frequencies between 6 kHz and 9 kHz, both nerve block and repetitive firing of action potentials can be observed at different stimulation intensities. When the stimulation frequency is below 6 kHz, nerve block does not occur regardless of stimulation intensity. Larger diameter axons have a lower threshold intensity to induce conduction block. When temperature is reduced from 37 degrees C to 20 degrees C, the lowest frequency to completely block large axons (diameters 10-20 microm) decreased from 8 kHz to 4 kHz. This simulation study can guide future animal experiments as well as optimize stimulation waveforms for electrical nerve block in clinical applications.},

abstract = {Tendon reflexes have been often used in studies of the human nervous system in health and disease. They have been investigated either in response to single tendon taps or to long duration vibrations. Tendon reflexes are described here in response to a high frequency vibration burst (3 cycles of a 100 Hz sine wave) applied to the Achilles tendon of standing subjects, either in quiet stance or during a forward leaning posture. The electromyogram from the soleus muscle usually showed three components separated by 10 ms which were interpreted as being three reflexes, each reflex induced by each of the three cycles in a burst. This result indicates that soleus tendon reflexes can respond in fast succession in a phasic manner when a brief high frequency vibration is applied to the Achilles tendon. This occurs in spite of possible depression of the la to motoneuron synapses and the long after hyperpolarization of the motoneurons. An interpretation of the results is that motoneurons from different subsets of the motoneuron pool respond to different cycles of the sinusoidal vibratory burst. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Experiments were designed to assess the relative contribution of rate coding and motor unit recruitment to force production in two muscles of different fiber and composition and function. Single motor unit action potentials were recorded during steady isometric contraction in biceps brachii, a large proximal limb muscle of mixed fiber composition, and adductor pollicis, a small hand muscle comprised mainly of type I muscle fibers. Action potential spike trains were obtained over the entire force range in each muscle. The results suggest that these two muscles are controlled in different ways. In biceps brachii, recruitment was observed from 0 to 88{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). In adductor pollicis, no motor unit was observed to be recruited at forces greater than 50{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC, with the majority of recruitment occurring below 30{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC. On the average, motor units in adductor pollicis discharged at higher rates, with less regularity, and with a greater frequency of occurrence of short interspike intervals (intervals ??? 20 msec) than those in biceps brachii. Such findings suggest that rate coding plays a more prominent role in force modulation in adductor pollicis, while recruitment plays a more important role throughout the contractile forece range in biceps brachii.},

The objective of this article is to validate a mathematical postural control model for quiet standing posture. The postural dynamics is modeled in the sagittal plane as an inverted pendulum with torque applied at the ankle joint. The torque control system is represented by the physiological lambda model. Two neurophysiological command variables of the central nervous system, designated lambda and micro, establish the dynamic threshold muscle at which motoneuron recruitment begins. Kinematic data and electromyographic signals were collected on four young males in order to measure small voluntary sway and quiet standing posture. Validation of the mathematical model was achieved through comparison of the experimental and simulated results. The mathematical model allows computation of the unmeasurable neurophysiological commands lambda and micro that control the equilibrium position and stability. Furthermore, with the model it is possible to conclude that low-amplitude body sway during quiet stance is commanded by the central nervous system.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to quantify the influence of selected motor unit properties and patterns of activity on amplitude cancellation in the simulated surface electromyogram (EMG). The study involved computer simulations of a motor unit population with physiologically defined recruitment and rate coding characteristics that activated muscle fibers whose potentials were recorded on the skin over the muscle. Amplitude cancellation was quantified as the percent difference in signal amplitude when motor unit potentials were summed before and after rectification. The simulations involved varying the level of activation for the motor unit population, the recording configuration, the upper limit of motor unit recruitment, peak discharge rates, the amount of motor unit synchronization, muscle fiber length, the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue, and the motor unit properties that change with advancing age. The results confirmed a previous experimental report (Day SJ and Hulliger M, J Neurophysiol 86: 2144-2158, 2001) that amplitude cancellation in the surface EMG can reach 62{\{}{\%}{\}} at maximal activation. A decrease in the range of amplitudes of the motor unit potentials, as can occur during fatiguing contractions, increased amplitude cancellation up to approximately 85{\{}{\%}{\}}. Differences in the amount of amplitude cancellation were observed across all simulated conditions, and resulted in substantial changes in the absolute magnitude of the EMG signal. The most profound factors influencing amplitude cancellation were the number of active motor units and the duration of the action potentials. The effects of amplitude cancellation were minimal (<5{\{}{\%}{\}}) when the EMG amplitude was normalized to maximal values, with the exception of variations in peak discharge rate and recruitment range, which resulted in differences up to 17{\{}{\%}{\}} in the normalized EMG signal across conditions. These results indicate the amount of amplitude cancellation that can occur in various experimental conditions and its influence on absolute and relative measures of EMG amplitude.},

abstract = {The relationship between synaptic or injecting input level and firing rate is an important metric to characterize neuron input-output dynamics. In this study, we examine two long-held, but never validated, assumptions in the "algebraic summation of afterhyperpolarization" theory, which explains how firing rate varies with input (typically referred to as input current-frequency modulation or "F-I gain"). In the theory, the afterhyperpolarizations themselves, along with spike threshold, were assumed constant. That is, whereas they were central concepts in the theory, they were not included in any feedback loops, wherein they could both affect and be affected by firing rate. We performed intracellular recordings from spinal motoneurons in the adult cat to determine whether F-I gain correlates with the afterhyperpolarization and/or spike threshold. We observe that the afterhyperpolarization does indeed appear to be out of the F-I gain mechanism loop, and thus that original assumption holds. However, the presented experimental evidence indicates that the spike threshold appears to be in the loop. That is, spike threshold variation associated with input correlates with F-I gain. We present an extension to the original theory, which explains the F-I gain experimental correlations.},

Analyses of the effect of joint configuration variance on the stability of the CM and head positions were performed using the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) approach. Subjects stood quietly with arms folded across their chests for three 5-min trials each with and without vision. The UCM analysis revealed that the six joints examined were coordinated such that their combined variance had minimal effect on the CM and head positions. Removing vision led to a structuring of the resulting increased joint variance such that little of the increase affected stability of the CM and head positions. The results reveal a control strategy involving coordinated variations of most major joints to stabilize variables important to postural control during quiet stance.},

@article{Bove2003,
abstract = {Stretching the soleus (Sol) muscle during sudden toe-up rotations of the supporting platform in a standing subject evokes a short-latency response (SLR) and a medium-latency response (MLR). The aim of the present investigation was to further explore the afferent and spinal pathways mediating the SLR and MLR in lower limb muscles by means of tendon vibration. In seven subjects, toe-up or toe-down rotations were performed under: (1) control, (2) continuous bilateral vibration at 90 Hz of Achilles' tendon or tibialis anterior (TA) tendon, and (3) post-vibration conditions. Sol and TA background EMG activity and reflex responses were bilaterally recorded and analysed. Toe-up rotations induced SLRs and MLRs in Sol at average latencies of 40 and 66 ms, respectively. During vibration, the latency of both responses increased by about 2 ms. The area of the SLR significantly decreased during vibration, regardless of the underlying background activity, and almost returned to control value post-vibration. The area of Sol MLR was less influenced by vibration than SLR, the reduction being negligible with relatively high background activity. However, contrary to SLR, MLR was even more reduced post-vibration. Toe-down rotations induced no SLR in the TA, while a MLR was evoked at about 81 ms. The area of TA MLR decreased slightly during vibration but much more post-vibration. SLRs and MLRs were differently affected by changing the vibration frequency to 30 Hz: vibration had a negligible effect on the SLR, but still produced a significant effect on the MLR. The independence from the background EMG of the inhibitory effect of vibration upon the SLR suggests that vibration removes a constant amount of the Ia afferent input. This can be accounted for by either presynaptic inhibition of group Ia fibres or a 'busy-line' phenomenon. The differential effect of vibration on SLRs and MLRs is compatible with the notions that spindle primaries have a higher sensitivity to vibration than secondaries, and that group II afferent fibres are responsible for the production of the MLR. The decrease of MLRs but not SLRs after vibration is discussed in terms of an interaction between peripheral and central drive on group II interneurones in order to produce sufficient EMG activity to maintain a given postural set.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frequency domain Granger causality measures have been proposed and widely applied in analyzing rhythmic neurophysiological and biomedical signals. Almost all these measures are based on linear time domain regression models, and therefore can only detect linear causal effects in the frequency domain.

NEW METHOD: A frequency domain causality measure, the partial directed coherence, is explicitly linked with the frequency response function concept of linear systems. By modeling the nonlinear relationships between time series using nonlinear models and employing corresponding frequency-domain analysis techniques (i.e., generalized frequency response functions), a new nonlinear partial directed coherence method is derived.

RESULTS: The advantages of the new method are illustrated via a numerical example of a nonlinear physical system and an application to electroencephalogram signals from a patient with childhood absence epilepsy.

COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The new method detects both linear and nonlinear casual effects between bivariate signals in the frequency domain, while the existing measures can only detect linear effects.

CONCLUSIONS: The proposed new method has important advantages over the classical linear measures, because detecting nonlinear dependencies has become more and more important in characterizing functional couplings in neuronal and biological systems.},

abstract = {Stochastic resonance (SR) has been shown to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and detection of low level signals in neurons. It is not yet clear how this effect of SR plays an important role in the information processing of neural networks. The objective of this article is to test the hypothesis that information transmission can be enhanced with SR when sub-threshold signals are applied to distal positions of the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neuron models. In the computer simulation, random sub-threshold signals were presented repeatedly to a distal position of the main apical branch, while the homogeneous Poisson shot noise was applied as a background noise to the mid-point of a basal dendrite in the CA1 neuron model consisting of the soma with one sodium, one calcium, and five potassium channels. From spike firing times recorded at the soma, the mutual information and information rate of the spike trains were estimated. The simulation results obtained showed a typical resonance curve of SR, and that as the activity (intensity) of sub-threshold signals increased, the maximum value of the information rate tended to increased and eventually SR disappeared. It is concluded that SR can play a key role in enhancing the information transmission of sub-threshold stimuli applied to distal positions on the dendritic trees.},

abstract = {Quantification of the degree of stenosis or vessel dimensions are important for diagnosis of vascular diseases and planning vascular interventions. Although diagnosis from three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA's) is mainly performed on two-dimensional (2-D) maximum intensity projections, automated quantification of vascular segments directly from the 3-D dataset is desirable to provide accurate and objective measurements of the 3-D anatomy. A model-based method for quantitative 3-D MRA is proposed. Linear vessel segments are modeled with a central vessel axis curve coupled to a vessel wall surface. A novel image feature to guide the deformation of the central vessel axis is introduced. Subsequently, concepts of deformable models are combined with knowledge of the physics of the acquisition technique to accurately segment the vessel wall and compute the vessel diameter and other geometrical properties. The method is illustrated and validated on a carotid bifurcation phantom, with ground truth and medical experts as comparisons. Also, results on 3-D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA images of the carotids are shown. The approach is a promising technique to assess several geometrical vascular parameters directly on the source 3-D images, providing an objective mechanism for stenosis grading.},

This study investigated the variability present in the sway patterns during quiet standing in patients with MS (PwMS) and healthy controls. Subjects were assessed (eyes open, closed) standing on a force platform. Variability of the sway patterns was quantified using a measure of amount of variability (root mean square; RMS) and two measures of temporal structure of variability (Lyapunov Exponent - LyE; Approximate Entropy - ApEn). RMS results revealed significantly higher amount of variability in the sway patterns of PwMS. PwMS also exhibit increased regularity (decreased ApEn) and decreased divergence (decreased LyE) during standing compared to healthy controls. Removing vision resulted in significantly decreased divergence (decreased LyE) in the MS subject group. These changes in the temporal structure correspond well with the theoretical model of the optimal movement variability hypothesis and the results support using variability measures to understand the mechanisms that underline postural control in PwMS and possibly other neurodegenerative disease pathologies. © 2012.},

abstract = {1. The output from Renshaw cells caused by a phasic motor volley was investigated when these neurones were submitted to a background firing secondary to a tonic motor discharge elicited by a repetitive stimulation of muscle group I afferents. It was invariably found in individual Renshaw cells that tonic excitation produced an increase in the additional ouput caused by the phasic motor volley. The curves displaying this increase exhibited a significant 'jump' when the output resulting from the combined tonic and phasic motor discharges ranged between 2 and 5 spikes during the first 10 msec following the phasic volley. 2. The whole pool of Renshaw cells was also considered by assessing the amount of recurrent inhibition in motoneurones following a phasic motor volley. Similarly it was found that additional recurrent inhibition elicited by a phasic motor volley was enhanced when the Renshaw cells received a tonic excitatory input. 3. The Renshaw cell discharges elicited by stimulation of two different nerves were compared when a conditioning stimulus was previously applied to only one of them. The results strongly suggest that a preceding volley caused a decrease in synaptic efficacy at the terminals of the recurrent collaterals. 4. The firing produced by current injected through the recording micro-electrode was investigated in one intracellularly recorded Renshaw cell. It was found that the current-frequency curve was linear for 'steady-state' firing but displayed a clearcut sigmoid shape for the earliest intervals before the final adaptation. 5. It is demonstrated that this sigmoid input-output relation in individual Renshaw cells is sufficient to explain how the controls acting on these neurones may change the gain in the recurrent pathway when Renshaw cells are fired by a phasic motor discharge. When Renshaw cells are fired by a longlasting tonic motor discharge the linear input-output relation in individual cells should not cause any modifications of the gain in the recurrent pathway. A change in this gain secondary to the effects of segmental and supraspinal control systems is, however, possible if the motor discharge creates a subliminal fringe within the pool of Renshaw cells.},

abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome is classified into acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) by electrodiagnostic and pathological criteria. In AMAN, the immune attack appears directed against the axolemma and nodes of Ranvier. Threshold tracking was used to measure indices of axonal excitability (refractoriness, supernormality, and threshold electrotonus) for median nerve axons at the wrist of patients with AMAN (n = 10) and AIDP (n = 8). Refractoriness (the increase in threshold current during the relative refractory period) was greatly increased in AMAN patients, but the abruptness of the threshold increases at short interstimulus intervals indicated conduction failure distal to the stimulation (ie, an increased refractory period of transmission). During the 4 week period from onset, the high refractoriness returned toward normal, and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential increased, consistent with improvement in the safety margin for impulse transmission in the distal nerve. In contrast, refractoriness was normal in AIDP, even though there was marked prolongation of distal latencies. Supernormality and threshold electrotonus were normal in both groups of patients, suggesting that, at the wrist, membrane potential was normal and pathology was relatively minor. These results support the view that the predominantly distal targets of immune attack are different for AMAN and AIDP. Possible mechanisms for the reduced safety factor in AMAN are discussed.},

abstract = {Modulations of beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) during normal motor control suggest that they may act to promote current motor set at the expense of new movements. These oscillations are greatly enhanced in Parkinson's disease (PD) and there is strong correlative evidence linking beta activity at rest and beta changes in response to treatment with bradykinesia and rigidity. Some evidence that this link may be mechanistically important or causal comes from studies in which either cortical or subcortical sites have been stimulated in the beta frequency range causing modest but significant slowing of movements. However, recent trials in which high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) has only been delivered during periods of elevated beta activity have demonstrated major clinical effects that even exceed those of standard continuous high frequency DBS. These studies suggest that beta activity may be both causally and quantitatively important in the motor impairment of PD, and demonstrate how improvements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PD can lead to enhanced therapeutic interventions in this condition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

These equations allow one to find, at a low computational cost, the musculotendon geometric parameters required for numerical simulation of large musculoskeletal models. Nominal values for these biomechanical parameters were established using a public-domain musculoskeletal model of the lower limb (IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 37 (1990) 757). To fit these nominal values, regression equations with different levels of complexity were generated, based on the number of generalized coordinates of the joints spanned by each musculotendon actuator. Least squares fitting was used to identify regression equation coefficients. The goodness of the fit and confidence intervals were assessed, and the best fitting equations selected.

A useful approach to represent and integrate complex data sets is to develop mathematical models [Arbib (The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks, pp. 741-745, 2003); Arbib and Grethe (Computing the Brain: A Guide to Neuroinformatics, 2001); Ascoli (Computational Neuroanatomy: Principles and Methods, 2002); Bower and Bolouri (Computational Modeling of Genetic and Biochemical Networks, 2001); Hines et al.

(Neuron 26, 567-580, 2000); Vadigepalli et al. (OMICS 7, 235-252, 2003)]. Models of neural systems provide quantitative and modifiable frameworks for representing data and analyzing neural function. These models can be developed and solved using neurosimulators. One such neurosimulator is simulator for neural networks and action potentials (SNNAP) [Ziv (J. Neurophysiol. 71, 294-308, 1994)]. SNNAP is a versatile and user-friendly tool for developing and simulating models of neurons and neural networks. SNNAP simulates many features of neuronal function, including ionic currents and their modulation by intracellular ions and/or second messengers, and synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. SNNAP is written in Java and runs on most computers. Moreover, SNNAP provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and does not require programming skills. This chapter describes several capabilities of SNNAP and illustrates methods for simulating neurons and neural networks. SNNAP is available at http://snnap.uth.tmc.edu .},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that human bipedal upright stance is achieved by feedback mechanisms that generate an appropriate corrective torque based on body-sway motion detected primarily by visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory systems. Because orientation information from the various senses is not always available (eyes closed) or accurate (compliant support surface), the postural control system must somehow adjust to maintain stance in a wide variety of environmental conditions. This is the sensorimotor integration problem that we investigated by evoking anterior-posterior (AP) body sway using pseudorandom rotation of the visual surround and/or support surface (amplitudes 0.5-8 degrees ) in both normal subjects and subjects with severe bilateral vestibular loss (VL). AP rotation of body center-of-mass (COM) was measured in response to six conditions offering different combinations of available sensory information. Stimulus-response data were analyzed using spectral analysis to compute transfer functions and coherence functions over a frequency range from 0.017 to 2.23 Hz. Stimulus-response data were quite linear for any given condition and amplitude. However, overall behavior in normal subjects was nonlinear because gain decreased and phase functions sometimes changed with increasing stimulus amplitude. "Sensory channel reweighting" could account for this nonlinear behavior with subjects showing increasing reliance on vestibular cues as stimulus amplitudes increased. VL subjects could not perform this reweighting, and their stimulus-response behavior remained quite linear. Transfer function curve fits based on a simple feedback control model provided estimates of postural stiffness, damping, and feedback time delay. There were only small changes in these parameters with increasing visual stimulus amplitude. However, stiffness increased as much as 60{\%} with increasing support surface amplitude. To maintain postural stability and avoid resonant behavior, an increase in stiffness should be accompanied by a corresponding increase in damping. Increased damping was achieved primarily by decreasing the apparent time delay of feedback control rather than by changing the damping coefficient (i.e., corrective torque related to body-sway velocity). In normal subjects, stiffness and damping were highly correlated with body mass and moment of inertia, with stiffness always about 1/3 larger than necessary to resist the destabilizing torque due to gravity. The stiffness parameter in some VL subjects was larger compared with normal subjects, suggesting that they may use increased stiffness to help compensate for their loss. Overall results show that the simple act of standing quietly depends on a remarkably complex sensorimotor control system.},

abstract = {The performance of motor tasks requires the coordinated control and continuous adjustment of myriad individual muscles. The basic commands for the successful performance of a sensorimotor task originate in "higher" centers such as the motor cortex, but the actual muscle activation and resulting torques and motion are considerably shaped by the integrative function of the spinal interneurons. The relative contributions of brain and spinal cord are less clear for reaching movements than for automatic tasks such as locomotion. We have modeled a two-axis, four-muscle wrist joint with realistic musculoskeletal mechanics and proprioceptors and a network of regulatory circuitry based on the classical types of spinal interneurons (propriospinal, monosynaptic Ia-excitatory, reciprocal Ia-inhibitory, Renshaw inhibitory, and Ib-inhibitory pathways) and their supraspinal control (via biasing activity, presynaptic inhibition, and fusimotor gain). The modeled system has a very large number of control inputs, not unlike the real spinal cord that the brain must learn to control to produce desired behaviors. It was surprisingly easy to program this model to emulate actual performance in four very different but well described behaviors: (1) stabilizing responses to force perturbations; (2) rapid movement to position target; (3) isometric force to a target level; and (4) adaptation to viscous curl force fields. Our general hypothesis is that, despite its complexity, such regulatory circuitry substantially simplifies the tasks of learning and producing complex movements.},

The culmination of gathered and processed information results in conscious awareness of joint position and motion, unconscious joint stabilisation through protective spinal-mediated reflexes and the maintenance of posture and balance. Clinical research aimed at determining the effects of articular musculoskeletal injury, surgery and rehabilitation, on joint proprioception, neuromuscular control and balance has focused on the knee and ankle joints.

abstract = {Donders' law, as applied to the arm, predicts that to every location of the hand in space there corresponds a unique posture of the arm as defined by shoulder and elbow angles. This prediction was tested experimentally by asking human subjects to make pointing movements to a select number of target locations starting from a wide range of initial hand locations. The posture of the arm was measured at the start and end of every movement by means of video cameras. It was found that, in general, the posture of the arm at a given hand location does depend on the starting location of the movement and that, consequently, Donders' law is violated in this experimental condition. Kinematic and kinetic factors that could account for the variations in arm posture were investigated. It proved impossible to predict the final posture of the arm purely from kinematics, based on the initial posture of the arm. One hypothesis was successful in predicting final arm postures, namely that the final posture minimizes the amount of work that must be done to transport the arm from the starting location.},

abstract = {The dependence of the form of the EMG-force relation on key motoneuron and muscle properties was explored using a simulation approach. Surface EMG signals and isometric forces were simulated using existing motoneuron pool, muscle force, and surface EMG models, based primarily on reported properties of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in humans. Our simulation results indicate that the relation between electrical and mechanical properties of the individual motor unit level plays the dominant role in determining the overall EMG amplitude-force relation of the muscle, while the underlying motor unit firing rate strategy appears to be a less important factor. However, different motor unit firing rate strategies result in substantially different relations between counts of the numbers of motoneuron discharges and the isometric force. Our simulation results also show that EMG amplitude (estimated as the average rectified value) increases as a result of synchronous discharges of different motor units within the pool, but the magnitude of this increase is determined primarily by the action potential duration of the synchronized motor units. Furthermore, when the EMG effects are normalized to their maximum levels, motor unit synchrony does not exert significant effects on the form of the EMG-force relation, provided that the synchrony level is held similar at different excitation levels.},

abstract = {The course and location of vestibulospinal, reticulospinal and descending propriospinal fibres in man are reported. The investigation was carried out on three patients with supraspinal lesions, four with transection of the spinal cord and 33 with anterolateral cordotomies. The lateral vestibulospinal tract at the medullospinal junction and in the first three cervical segments lies on the periphery of the spinal cord lateral to the anterior roots. It moves to the sulcomarginal angle in the remaining cervical segments. In the thoracic cord, it moves laterally, being traversed by the most lateral of the anterior roots. Reticulospinal fibres descend bilaterally in the spinal cord with a preponderance of ipsilateral fibres. Reticulospinal fibres in general do not form well-defined tracts, but are scattered throughout the anterior and lateral columns. They are intermingled with propriospinal fibres and with ascending and descending fibres of other systems. Most reticulospinal fibres move posterolaterally as they descend. It follows that fibres from the brainstem that enter the cord in the anterior column may be in the lateral column anterior to the lateral corticospinal tract at lower levels. Reticulospinal fibres within the lateral column lie anterior to the lateral corticospinal tract. They consist of scattered fibres between the lateral horn and the periphery, most of them in the medial two-thirds of the column. In addition, they are present in a more compact group, forming a triangle on transverse section on the periphery of the lateral column, immediately anterior to the lateral corticospinal tract. On the periphery of the anterior and anterolateral columns reticulospinal fibres descend as small groups or as a continuous band of fibres. The most medial of these reaches the sacral segments and is included in the sulcomarginal fasciculus. A compact group of fibres, shown previously to be central sympathetic fibres ending in the intermediolateral and intermediomedial cell columns, surrounds the lateral horn. They do not extend throughout the thoracic cord in all cases. Anterior to this group is another group of fibres lying on the anterolateral surface of the anterior horn. As these fibres were degenerating following a pontine lesion, they must be reticulospinal fibres. The fibres were not seen in all cases and they did not always reach the lowest thoracic segments. Reticulospinal fibres enter the grey matter in the zona intermedia and along the anterolateral and anterior surfaces of the anterior horns. Caudal to the cervical enlargement, the number of reticulospinal fibres decreases, and their place is taken by propriospinal fibres. But they are not totally replaced by the propriospinal fibres, for reticulospinal fibres continue down into the lowest sacral segments. Of the propriospinal fibres, the majority are short: descending fibres within the juxtagriseal layer are one to two segments long or less.},

abstract = {In humans, during standing the calf muscles soleus and gastrocnemius actively prevent forward toppling about the ankles. It has been generally assumed that these postural muscles behave like springs with dynamic stiffness reflecting their mechanical properties, reflex gain including higher derivatives, and central control. Here, for the first time, we have used an ultrasound scanner and automated image analysis to record the tiny muscular movements occurring in normal standing. This new, non-invasive technique resolves changes in muscle length as small as 10 mum without disturbing the standing process. This technical achievement has allowed us to test the long-established mechano-reflex, muscle spring hypothesis that muscle length changes in a spring-like way during sway of the body. Our results contradict that hypothesis. Muscle length changes in a non-spring-like manner: on average, shortening during forward sway and lengthening during backwards sway (paradoxical movements). This counter-intuitive result is a consequence of the fact that calf muscles generate tension through a series elastic component (SEC, Achilles tendon and foot) which limits maximal ankle stiffness to 92 +/- 20{\%} of that required to balance the body. Paradoxical movements cannot be generated by stretch reflexes with constant intrafusal drive but might be produced by reflex coupling of extrafusal (alpha) and intrafusal (beta, gamma) drive or by positive force feedback. Standing requires the predictive ability to produce the observed muscle movements preceded (110 +/- 50 ms) by corresponding changes in integrated EMG signal. We suggest higher level anticipatory control is more plausible.},

abstract = {The human soleus H-reflex is commonly tested as an indicator of the reflex excitability of the calf muscles with infrequent stimuli to a subject seated and at rest. However, the reflex varies widely with the level of voluntary contraction and with the time history of stimulation. We studied two aspects of this variation. Antagonist (tibialis anterior) activation decreases the response, while increasing agonist (soleus) activation increases the H-reflex to a peak after which it declines. In subjects with large H-reflexes at rest, the reflex peaked at low levels of contraction. In contrast, in subjects with small H-reflexes at rest, the reflex peaked at higher levels of contraction for reasons that were elucidated using a realistic computer model. A parabolic curve fitted the maximum amplitude of the H-reflex in the model and over the entire range of contractile levels studied. The second aspect studied was post-activation depression or homosynaptic depression (HD), which has been described previously as a reduction of a second H-reflex elicited shortly after an initial reflex. We confirmed the presence of HD in resting, seated subjects for intervals up to 4 s. However, by voluntarily activating the soleus muscle, HD was drastically reduced when seated and abolished when standing. This suggests that HD may be absent in normal, functional movements and perhaps in clinical conditions that alter H-reflexes. Meaningful, quantitative measurements of reflex excitability can only be made under voluntary activity that mimics the condition of interest.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of surface inclination angle, standing direction, and lumbar extensor fatigue on postural control during quiet standing. A group of 16 young, healthy participants were tested while standing on inclined surfaces before and after lumbar extensor fatigue (induced by repetitive isotonic exercise). Three inclination angles (0°, 18° and 26°) and three standing directions (uphill, downhill, and lateral facing) were examined. Postural control was assessed using several measures derived from center-of-pressure time series and subjectively perceived stability. Significant main and interactive effects of inclination angle and standing direction were found for all dependent measures. The adverse effects of standing on inclined surfaces were found to differ between the three standing directions. In general, dose-response relationships with inclination angle were evident, particularly in the lateral-facing direction. Fatigue-related effects differed between conditions, suggesting that the adverse effect of lumbar extensor fatigue on postural control depend on inclination angle and standing direction. These findings may facilitate the development of fall prevention interventions for work involving inclined surfaces.},

abstract = {Coherence between the bioelectric activity of sensorimotor cortex and contralateral muscles can be observed around 20 Hz. By contrast, physiological tremor has a dominant frequency around 10 Hz. Although tremor has multiple sources, it is partly central in origin, reflecting a component of motoneuron discharge at this frequency. The motoneuron response to {\{}{\~{}}{\}}20 Hz descending input could be altered by non-linear interactions with {\{}{\~{}}{\}}10 Hz motoneuron firing. We investigated this further in eight healthy human subjects by testing the effects of the beta-adrenergic agents propranolol (non-selective $\beta$-antagonist) and salbutamol ($\beta$(2)-agonist), which are known to alter the size of physiological tremor. Corticomuscular coherence was assessed during an auxotonic precision grip task; tremor was quantified using accelerometry during index finger extension. Experiments with propranolol used a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. A single oral dose of propranolol (40 mg) significantly increased beta band (15.3-32.2 Hz) corticomuscular coherence compared with placebo, but reduced tremor in the 6.2-11.9 Hz range. Salbutamol (2.5 mg) was administered by inhalation. Whilst salbutamol significantly increased tremor amplitude as expected, it did not change corticomuscular coherence. The opposite direction of the effects of propranolol on corticomuscular coherence and tremor, and the fact that salbutamol enhances tremor but does not affect coherence, implies that the magnitude of corticomuscular coherence is little influenced by non-linear interactions with 10 Hz oscillations in motoneurons or the periphery. Instead, we suggest that propranolol and salbutamol may affect both tremor and corticomuscular coherence partly via a central site of action.},

A complete recovery necessitated 40 s. The static stretch sensitivity of the units was decreased during the 3 s following vibration exposure and returned to the control level (about 14 s).

abstract = {The rate of change in the fluctuations in motor output differs during the performance of fatiguing contractions that involve different types of loads. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of frequency modulation of motor unit discharge to the fluctuations in the motor output during sustained contractions with the force and position tasks. In separate tests with the upper arm vertical and the elbow flexed to 1.57 rad, the seated subjects maintained either a constant upward force at the wrist ( force task) or a constant elbow angle ( position task). The force and position tasks were performed in random order at a target force equal to 3.6 +/- 2.1{\{}{\%}{\}} ( mean +/- SD) of the maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC) force above the recruitment threshold of an isolated motor unit from the biceps brachii. Each subject maintained the two tasks for an identical duration ( 161 +/- 93 s) at a mean target force of 22.4 +/- 13.6{\{}{\%}{\}} MVC. As expected, the rate of increase in the fluctuations in motor output ( force task: SD for detrended force; position task: SD for vertical acceleration) was greater for the position task than the force task ( P < 0.001). The amplitude of the coefficient of variation ( CV) and the power spectra for motor unit discharge were similar between tasks ( P > 0.1) and did not change with time ( P > 0.1), and could not explain the different rates of increase in motor output fluctuations for the two tasks. Nonetheless, frequency modulation of motor unit discharge differed during the two tasks and predicted ( P < 0.001) both the CV for discharge rate ( force task: 1 - 3, 12 - 13, and 14 - 15 Hz; position task: 0 - 1, and 1 - 2 Hz) and the fluctuations in motor output ( force task: 5 - 6, 9 - 10, 12 - 13, and 14 - 15 Hz; position task: 6 - 7, 14 - 15, 17 - 19, 20 - 21, and 23 - 24 Hz). Frequency modulation of motor unit discharge rate differed for the force and position tasks and influenced the ability to sustain steady contractions.},

abstract = {Introduction: The learning of core concepts in neuroscience can be reinforced by a hands-on approach, either experimental or computer-based. In this work, we present a web-based multi-scale neuromuscular simulator that is being used as a teaching aid in a campus-wide course on the Principles of Neuroscience. Methods: The simulator has several built-in individual models based on cat and human biophysics, which are interconnected to represent part of the neuromuscular system that controls leg muscles. Examples of such elements are i) single neurons, representing either motor neurons or interneurons mediating reciprocal, recurrent and Ib inhibition; ii) afferent fibers that can be stimulated to generate spinal reflexes; iii) muscle unit models, generating force and electromyogram; and iv) stochastic inputs, representing the descending volitional motor drive. Results: Several application examples are provided in the present report, ranging from studies of individual neuron responses to the collective action of many motor units controlling muscle force generation. A subset of them was included in an optional homework assignment for Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering graduate students enrolled in the course cited above at our University. Almost all students rated the simulator as a good or an excellent learning tool, and approximately 90{\{}{\%}{\}} declared that they would use the simulator in future projects. Conclusion: The results allow us to conclude that multi-scale neuromuscular simulator is an effective teaching tool. Special features of this free teaching resource are its direct usability from any browser (http://remoto.leb.usp.br/), its user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and the preset demonstrations.},

abstract = {A parallel-cascade system identification method was used to identify intrinsic and reflex contributions to dynamic ankle stiffness over a wide range of tonic voluntary contraction levels and ankle positions in healthy human subjects. Intrinsic stiffness dynamics were described well by a linear pathway having elastic, viscous, and inertial properties. A velocity-sensitive pathway comprising a delay, a static non-linearity, resembling a half-wave rectifier, followed by a low-pass filter, described reflex stiffness dynamics. The absolute magnitude of intrinsic and reflex stiffness parameters varied from subject to subject but the relative changes with contraction level and position were consistent. Intrinsic stiffness increased monotonically with contraction level while reflex stiffness was maximal at low contraction levels and then decreased. Intrinsic and reflex stiffness both increased as the ankle was dorsiflexed. As a result, reflex mechanics made their largest relative contributions near the neutral position at low levels of activity. The size of the maximum reflex contribution varied widely among subjects, in some it was so small (ca 1{\%}) that it would be unlikely to have any functional importance; however, in other subjects, reflex contributions were large enough (as high as 55{\%} in one case) to play a significant role in the control of posture and movement. This variability may have arisen because stretch reflexes were not useful for the torque-matching task in these experiments. It will be of interest to examine other tasks where stretch reflexes would have a direct impact on performance.},

abstract = {Ankle clonus and soleus medium-latency reflex are stretch-induced responses. Clonus is traditionally considered to be the result of oscillation in the group Ia mediated spinal stretch reflex but the soleus medium-latency reflex response originates mainly from the activation of group II afferents. The medium latency reflex response (MLR) was recorded in soleus muscle by peroneal nerve stimulation and clonus beats were recorded in soleus muscle using EMG in 19 spastic patients. The dorsiflexion (DF) and plantarflexion (PF) times of clonus and the half-period were calculated based on accelerometric measurements in 11 patients. The MLR of the soleus was 73.63+/-8.9ms. The half-period of the clonus was 79.34+/-12.31ms. The difference between the MLR and half-period was significant. The PF was 71.75+/-6.73ms, and the DF was 88.63+/-10.83ms. The difference between the soleus MLR and PF part of the clonus beat was not significant. The PF part of the clonus beat is due to soleus muscle contraction and controlled by the neural part of the oscillation. There may be relationship between the soleus MLR and the PF part of the clonus. Clonus is considered to be the result of oscillations in the group Ia spinal stretch reflex, but there is sufficient time for group II afferents to be involved.},

@article{Clancy2006,
abstract = {Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between surface electromyogram (EMG) and torque exerted about a joint. Most studies have used conventional EMG amplitude (EMGamp) processing, such as rectification followed by low-pass filtering, to pre-process the EMG before relating it to torque. Recently, advanced EMGamp processors that incorporate signal whitening and multiple-channel combination have been shown to significantly improve EMGamp processing. In this study, we compared the performance of EMGamp-torque estimators with and without these advanced EMGamp processors. Fifteen subjects produced constant-posture, non-fatiguing, force-varying contractions about the elbow while torque and biceps/triceps EMG were recorded. EMGamp was related to torque using a linear FIR model. Both whitening and multiple-channel combination reduced EMG-torque errors and their combination provided an additive benefit. Using a 15th-order linear FIR model, EMG-torque errors with a four-channel, whitened processor averaged 7.3{\%} of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) (or 78{\%} of variance accounted for). By comparison, the equivalent single-channel, unwhitened (conventional) processor produced an average error of 9.9{\%} of MVC (variance accounted for of 55{\%}). In addition, the study describes the occurrence of spurious peaks in estimated torque when the torque model is created from data with a sampling rate well above the bandwidth of the torque. This problem occurs when the torque data are sampled at the same rate as the EMG data. The problem is corrected by decimating the EMGamp prior to relating it to joint torque, in our case to an effective sampling rate of 40.96 Hz. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sosnoff JJ, Shin S, Motl RW. Multiple sclerosis and postural control: the role of spasticity. Objectives: To examine the association between spasticity and postural control in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Motor control laboratory. Participants: Subjects with MS (n=16, 2 male) and age and sex-matched subjects (n=16) participated in the investigation. All subjects with MS had Expanded Disability Status Scale scores between 0 and 4.5 and modified Ashworth scale scores between 1 and 3. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Postural control was measured with a force platform that quantifies ground reaction forces and moments in mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. Postural control was indexed with anterior-posterior sway range, medial-lateral sway range, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} elliptical area of the deviations of center of pressure (COP), velocity of COP sway, and the frequency at which 95{\{}{\%}{\}} of spectral profile was contained. Participants with MS further underwent assessment of the soleus Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) as an index of spasticity. Results: Cluster analysis on H-reflex data identified groups of MS participants with high spasticity (n=7) and low spasticity (n=9). There were no differences in age, duration of MS, and disease severity between MS groups. There were no differences in anterior-posterior sway range between any of the groups. The high spasticity group had greater COP area, velocity, and mediolateral sway compared with the low spasticity and control group, and the low spasticity group had postural control values between the high spasticity and control groups. Conclusions: The pattern of results suggests that spasticity contributes to postural deficits observed in MS. ?? 2010 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

@article{Hu2014,
abstract = {Objective . Muscle force is generated by a combination of motor unit (MU) recruitment and changes in the discharge rate of active MUs. There have been two basic MU recruitment and firing rate paradigms reported in the literature, which describe the control of the MUs during force generation. The first (termed the reverse ‘onion skin’ profile), exhibits lower firing rates for lower threshold units, with higher firing rates occurring in higher threshold units. The second (termed the ‘onion skin’ profile), exhibits an inverse arrangement, with lower threshold units reaching higher firing rates. Approach . Using a simulation of the MU activity in a hand muscle, this study examined the force generation capacity and the variability of the muscle force magnitude at different excitation levels of the MU pool under these two different MU control paradigms. We sought to determine which rate/recruitment scheme was more efficient for force generation, and which scheme gave rise to the lowest force variability. Main results . We found that the force output of both firing patterns leads to graded force output at low excitation levels, and that the force generation capacity of the two different paradigms diverged around 50{\{}{\%}{\}} excitation. In the reverse ‘onion skin’ pattern, at 100{\{}{\%}{\}} excitation, the force output reached up to 88{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximum force, whereas for the ‘onion skin’ pattern, the force output only reached up to 54{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximum force at 100{\{}{\%}{\}} excitation. The force variability was lower at the low to moderate force levels under the ‘onion skin’ paradigm than with the reverse ‘onion skin’ firing patterns, but this effect was reversed at high force levels. Significance . This study captures the influence of MU recruitment and firing rate organization on muscle force properties, and our results suggest that the different firing organizations can be beneficial at different levels of voluntary muscle force generation and perhaps for different tasks.},

The results obtained provide, for the first time, direct evidence showing that the motor cortex is able to modify, in a highly selective manner, the synaptic effectiveness of individual collaterals of the same primary afferent fiber. This presynaptic control could function as a mechanism that allows funneling of information to specific groups of spinal neurons in the presence of extensive intraspinal branching of the afferent fibers.},

@article{Feldman2009,
abstract = {According to a view that has dominated the field for over a century, the brain programs muscle commands and uses a copy of these commands [efference copy (EC)] to adjust not only resulting motor action but also ongoing perception. This view was helpful in formulating several classical problems of action and perception: (1) the posture-movement problem of how movements away from a stable posture can be made without evoking resistance of posture-stabilizing mechanisms resulting from intrinsic muscle and reflex properties; (2) the problem of kinesthesia or why our sense of limb position is good despite ambiguous positional information delivered by proprioceptive and cutaneous signals; (3) the problem of visual space constancy or why the world is perceived as stable while its retinal image shifts following changes in gaze. On closer inspection, the EC theory actually does not solve these problems in a physiologically feasible way. Here solutions to these problems are proposed based on the advanced formulation of the equilibrium-point hypothesis that suggests that action and perception are accomplished in a common spatial frame of reference selected by the brain from a set of available frames. Experimental data suggest that the brain is also able to translate or/and rotate the selected frame of reference by modifying its major attributes-the origin, metrics and orientation-and thus substantially influence action and perception. Because of this ability, such frames are called physical to distinguish them from symbolic or mathematical frames that are used to describe system behavior without influencing this behavior. Experimental data also imply that once a frame of reference is chosen, its attributes are modified in a feedforward way, thus enabling the brain to act in an anticipatory and predictive manner. This approach is extended to sense of effort, kinesthetic illusions, phantom limb and phantom body phenomena. It also addresses the question of why retinal images of objects are sensed as objects located in the external, physical world, rather than in internal representations of the brain.},

@article{Dai2002,
abstract = {During fictive locomotion the excitability of adult cat lumbar motoneurones is increased by a reduction (a mean hyperpolarization of similar to6.0 mV) of voltage threshold (Vth) for action potential (AP) initiation that is accompanied by only small changes in AP height and width. Further examination of the experimental data in the present study confirms that Vth lowering is present to a similar degree in both the hyperpolarized and depolarized portions of the locomotor step cycle. This indicates that Vth reduction is a modulation of motoneurone membrane currents throughout the locomotor state rather than being related to the phasic synaptic input within the locomotor cycle. Potential ionic mechanisms of this locomotor-state-dependent increase in excitability were examined using three five-compartment models of the motoneurone innervating slow, fast fatigue resistant and fast fatigable muscle fibres. Passive and active membrane conductances were set to produce input resistance, rheobase, afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and membrane time constant values similar to those measured in adult cat motoneurones in non-locomoting conditions. The parameters of 10 membrane conductances were then individually altered in an attempt to replicate the hyperpolarization of Vth that occurs in decerebrate cats during fictive locomotion. The goal was to find conductance changes that could produce a greater than 3 mV hyperpolarization of Vth with only small changes in AP height (<3 mV) and width (<1.2 ms). Vth reduction without large changes in AP shape could be produced either by increasing fast sodium current or by reducing delayed rectifier potassium current. The most effective Vth reductions were achieved by either increasing the conductance of fast sodium channels or by hyperpolarizing the voltage dependency of their activation. These changes were particularly effective when localized to the initial segment. Reducing the conductance of delayed rectifier channels or depolarizing their activation produced similar but smaller changes in Vth. Changes in current underlying the AHP, the persistent Na+ current, three Ca2+ currents, the 'h' mixed cation current, the 'A' potassium current and the leak current were either ineffective in reducing Vth or also produced gross changes in the AP. It is suggested that the increased excitability of motoneurones during locomotion could be readily accomplished by hyperpolarizing the voltage dependency of fast sodium channels in the axon hillock by a hitherto unknown neuromodulatory action.},

abstract = {In order to assess the relative contribution and the interactions of the plantar cutaneous and muscle proprioceptive feedback in controlling human erect posture, single or combined vibratory stimuli were applied to the forefoot areas and to the tendons of the tibialis anterior muscles of nine standing subjects using various vibration frequency patterns (ranging from 20 to 80 Hz). The variations in the centre of foot pressure, ankle angle and the EMG activities of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles of each subject were recorded and analysed. Separate stimulation of the plantar forefoot zones or the tibialis anterior muscles always resulted in whole-body tilts oppositely directed backwards and forwards, respectively, the amplitude of which was proportional to the vibration frequency. EMG activity of ankle muscles also varied according to the direction of the postural responses. However, the same vibration frequency did not elicit equivalent postural responses: in the low frequency range, tactile stimulation induced stronger postural effects than proprioceptive stimulation, and the converse was the case for the higher frequency range. Under sensory conflict conditions, i.e. foot sole-flexor ankle muscle co-stimulation, the direction of the body tilts also varied according to the difference and the absolute levels of the vibration frequencies. In all cases, the resulting postural shifts always corresponded to the theoretical sum of the isolated effects observed upon vibrating each of these two sensory channels. We proposed that tactile and proprioceptive information from the foot soles and flexor ankle muscles might be co-processed following a vector addition mode to subserve the maintenance of erect stance in a complementary way.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It has recently been demonstrated in the cat and in healthy subjects that the effects of repetitive afferent fibre stimulation depends on the target spinal neurones. The purpose of this series of experiments was therefore to determine whether central nervous system lesions modify the behaviour of the inhibitory spinal pathways in response to repetitive activation of afferent fibres. METHODS: The H-reflex technique was used to study the effect of increasing the conditioning stimulus rate from 0.16 to 1Hz on disynaptic inhibition and on presynaptic Ia inhibition on the affected side of 36 hemiplegic patients. RESULTS: The major finding was that, similar to results previously obtained in healthy subjects, increasing the conditioning stimulus rate in hemiplegic patients leads to an increase in the synaptic efficiency of inhibitory spinal circuits. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the severity of flexor carpi radialis muscle spasticity and the amount of disynaptic inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The reinforcement of inhibitory spinal networks induced by repetitive stimulation of afferent fibres is preserved in spastic patients, whereas the mechanisms underlying this phenomena might be altered. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of these experiments open up a number of possibilities for novel spasticity therapies based on non-invasive techniques.},

abstract = {Eccentric training is a mechanical loading classically used in clinical environment to rehabilitate patients with tendinopathies. In this context, eccentric training is supposed to alter tendon mechanical properties but interaction with the other components of the muscle-tendon complex remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the specific effects of 14 wk of eccentric training on muscle and tendon mechanical properties assessed in active and passive conditions in vivo. Twenty-four subjects were randomly divided into a trained group (n = 11) and a control group (n = 13). Stiffness of the active and passive parts of the series elastic component of plantar flexors were determined using a fast stretch during submaximal isometric contraction, Achilles tendon stiffness and dissipative properties were assessed during isometric plantar flexion, and passive stiffness of gastrocnemii muscles and Achilles tendon were determined using ultrasonography while ankle joint was passively moved. A significant decrease in the active part of the series elastic component stiffness was found (P < 0.05). In contrast, a significant increase in Achilles tendon stiffness determined under passive conditions was observed (P < 0.05). No significant change in triceps surae muscles and Achilles tendon geometrical parameters was shown (P > 0.05). Specific changes in muscle and tendon involved in plantar flexion are mainly due to changes in intrinsic mechanical properties of muscle and tendon tissues. Specific assessment of both Achilles tendon and plantar flexor muscles allowed a better understanding of the functional behavior of the muscle-tendon complex and its adaptation to eccentric training.},

abstract = {Far-field potentials have been produced from muscle tissue and shown to arise from both the proximal and distal musculotendinous junctions after the activation of a small group of muscle fibers. This investigation demonstrated that the polarity of muscle far-field potentials is consistent with the predictions of the leading/trailing dipole model. Far-field potential polarity was dependent upon the active electrode's orientation with respect to the positive or negative aspect of the trailing dipole after extinction of the leading dipole at the muculotendinous junction. This study also quantitatively measured the duration and magnitude of the two far-field potentials generated in the human biceps muscle by both proximal and distal muscle stimulation. The muscle far-field potential resulting from distal muscle stimulation closest to the musculotendinous junction was consistently shorter in mean duration (5.2msec +/- 2.1) but larger in mean amplitude (22.3-mu-V +/- 12.9) compared with the second far-field potential mean duration (10.4msec +/- 3.9) and amplitude (10.0-mu-V +/- 3.7). The mean areas under the curve for these far-field potentials, however, were comparable at 48.0msec-mu-V and 48.7msec-mu-V. Proximal muscle stimulation resulted in similar findings for the first far-field potential's mean duration, amplitude, and area (6.0msec; 19.7-mu-V; 50.6msec-mu-V, respectively) in relation to those of the second far-field potential (12.5msec; 9.1-mu-V 49.1msec-mu-V). The differences in amplitude and duration of the two far-field potentials, with similar areas, are consistent with, and can be adequately explained by, temporal dispersion effects of the muscle fiber action potentials' propagation over distance.},

abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS) is an acute, post-infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune peripheral neuropathy with a highly diverse clinical course and outcome. We classified GBS on the basis of patients' first nerve conduction and validated this system to be associated with outcome on the basis of electrophysiological characteristics during the acute phase of GBS. We retrospectively evaluated 40 GBS patients who underwent their first electrophysiological study within 14 days of onset and classified GBS into four patterns: (1) acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) pattern with sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor-sensory AIDP: MS-AIDP), (2) AIDP pattern without sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor AIDP: M-AIDP), (3) acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) pattern, and (4) minor abnormalities pattern. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory findings between groups and determined subgroups associated with poor outcome. The MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns more frequently exhibited prolonged recovery compared with the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns and were associated with prolonged recovery (specificity, 100 {\%}; sensitivity, 73 {\%}; P < 0.001). The period of inability to walk independently was significantly longer in the MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns than in the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns (median 85 vs. 10 days; P < 0.001). In conclusion, our classification of GBS using a single nerve conduction study in the early phase of disease is associated with outcomes. This classification can be used to counsel individual patients and guide decision-making with respect to treatment.},

The same information is required for perception during haptic exploration of an object. Much of these data are relayed by the mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the glabrous skin of the digits. Single afferent responses are modulated by all the relevant stimulus parameters. Thus, only in complete population reconstructions is it clear how each of the parameters can be signaled to the brain independently when many are changing simultaneously, as occurs in most normal movements or haptic exploration. Modeling population responses reveals how resolution is affected by neural noise and intrinsic properties of the population such as the pattern and density of innervation and the covariance of response variability.},

abstract = {Slowly adapting type I (SA-I) mechanoreceptors encode the edges and curvature of touched objects by generating neural spikes in response to indentation of the skin. Beneath this general input-output relationship, models are of great utility for understanding the sub-processes, as SA-I transduction sites are inaccessible to whole-cell recording. This work develops and validates a SA-I skin-receptor model that combines a finite element model of skin mechanics, a sigmoidal function of transduction, and a leaky integrate-and-fire model of neural dynamics. The model produced a R(2)=0.80 goodness of fit between predicted and observed firing rates for 3 and 5mm grating stimuli. In addition, modulation indices of predicted firing rates for 3 and 5mm gratings are 0.46 and 0.59, respectively, compared to the 0.71 and 0.72 found in vivo. An analysis of predicted first spikes indicates their latency may also be enhanced by edges, as edge proximity shortened first spike latencies by 26.2 and 41.8 ms for the 3 and 5mm gratings, respectively. The model described here bridges the gap between those models that transform sustained indentation to firing rates and those that transform vibration to spike times.},

abstract = {1. Nerve impulses were recorded from spindle afferents of the soleus muscle during sinusoidal changes in muscle length at frequencies from 0.03 to 300 c/s. This was done in the decerebrate cat with intact motor outflow and ;spontaneous' fusimotor activity. Computer averaging over a number of cycles was used to measure the response, in impulses/sec, at different phases of the cycle.2. A linear range was described in which the discharges of the endings were approximately sinusoidally modulated, and in which increasing the amplitude of the stretching produced a proportional increase in the response. At 1 c/s the linear range extended up to only about 0.1 mm for primary endings, but was greater than 1 mm for secondary endings.3. The sensitivity of an ending in its linear range was defined as the amplitude of its response divided by the amplitude of the length change. The sensitivity of both primary and secondary endings increased progressively on increasing the frequency of stretching above 1 c/s. The experimental observations relating the sensitivity to the sinusoidal frequency were fitted over much of the range by a curve given by the vector sum of components proportional to the length and to the velocity of stretching. This curve has two parameters, a sensitivity at low frequencies (S), and a corner frequency (F) at which the length and velocity contributions are equal. The value of F was about 1.5 c/s for both primary and secondary muscle spindle endings. The value of S was very much greater for primary endings (median value 95 impulses/sec/mm) than for secondary endings (median value 7 impulses/sec/mm). The increasing sensitivity of the endings at higher frequencies caused a progressive reduction in the linear range when it was expressed as an amplitude of stretching, but it remained approximately constant when it was expressed as a modulation of the frequency of discharge.4. The primary endings were also extremely sensitive to maintained changes in length provided they were of sufficiently small amplitude.5. In the presence of fusimotor activity a high sensitivity of small changes was found over a wide range of muscle lengths. De-efferented endings had a comparable high sensitivity when the muscle was at or beyond physiological full extension, but not when the muscle was shorter.6. The results are contrasted with those obtained previously using stretches of large amplitude, and the physiological significance of the high sensitivity of primary endings to small stretches is discussed in relation to the reflex control of movement.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal simulations of human movement commonly use Hill muscle models to predict muscle forces, but their sensitivity to model parameter values is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate muscle model sensitivity to perturbations in 14 Hill muscle model parameters in forward dynamic simulations of running and walking by varying each by +/- 50{\{}{\%}{\}}. Three evaluations of the muscle model were performed based on: (1) calculating the sensitivity of the muscle model only, (2) determining the continuous partial derivatives of the muscle equations with respect to each parameter, and (3) evaluating the effects on the running and walking simulations. Model evaluations were found to be very sensitive (percent change in outputs greater than parameter perturbation) to parameters defining the series elastic component (tendon), force-length curve of the contractile element and maximum isometric force. For some parameters, the range of literature values was larger than the model sensitivity. Model evaluations were insensitive to parameters defining the parallel elastic element, force-velocity curve of the contractile element and muscle activation time constants. The derivative method provided similar results, but also provided a generic, continuous equation that can easily be applied to other motions. The sensitivities of the running and walking simulations were reduced compared to the sensitivity of the muscle model alone. Results demonstrate the importance of evaluating sensitivity of a musculoskeletal simulation in a controlled manner and provide an indication of which parameters must be selected most carefully based on the sensitivity of a given movement.

abstract = {In human standing, gravity causes forward toppling about the ankle joint which is prevented by activity in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. It has long been assumed that when people sway forwards the calf muscles are stretched and conversely that they shorten with backward sway. Consequently, for many years, two explanations for standing stabilization have flourished. First, tonic muscle activity itself may generate adequate intrinsic ankle stiffness. Second, if intrinsic ankle stiffness is inadequate, the resistance to stretch of the calf muscles may be augmented by stretch reflexes or by central control. These explanations require that the passive tissue (Achilles' tendon, foot) transmitting the calf muscle tension is stiff. However, our recent measurements have indicated that this passive tissue is not stiff during standing. Accordingly, we predicted a counterintuitive mode of control where the muscles and body must, on average, move in opposite directions (paradoxical movements). Here we use dynamic ultrasound imaging in vivo with novel automated tracking of muscle length to test our hypothesis. We show that soleus and gastrocnemius do indeed move paradoxically, shortening when the body sways forward and lengthening when the body returns. This confirms that intrinsic ankle stiffness is too low to stabilize human standing. Moreover, it shows that the increase in active tension is associated with muscle shortening. This pattern cannot be produced by muscle stretch reflexes and can only arise from the anticipatory neural control of muscle length that is necessary for balance.},

However, in spite of the fact that some of these techniques have been used for over 30 years, there is still no consensus on the best way to estimate the characteristics of synaptic potentials or on the accuracy of these estimates. In this review, we compare different techniques for estimating synaptic potentials from human motor unit discharge and also discuss relevant animal models in which estimated synaptic potentials can be compared to those directly measured from intracellular recordings. We also review the experimental evidence on how synaptic noise and intrinsic motoneuron properties influence their responses to synaptic inputs. Finally, we consider to what extent recordings of single motor unit discharge in humans can be used to distinguish the contribution of changes in synaptic inputs versus changes in intrinsic motoneuron properties to altered motoneuron responses following CNS injury.},

abstract = {We characterized upper trunk and pelvis motion in normal subjects and in subjects with vestibular or proprioceptive loss, to document upper body movement modes in the pitch and roll planes during quiet stance. Six bilateral vestibular loss (VL), six bilateral lower-leg proprioceptive loss (PL) and 28 healthy subjects performed four stance tasks: standing on firm or foam surface with eyes open or closed. Motion of the upper body was measured using two pairs of body-worn gyroscopes, one mounted at the pelvis and the other pair at the shoulders. Pitch and roll angular velocities recorded from the gyroscopes were analyzed separately for low-frequency (<0.7 Hz) and high-frequency (>3 Hz) motion. Low-frequency pitch motion was similar for all groups, consisting of in-phase pelvis and shoulder motion. High-frequency pitch motion in controls and VL subjects was dominated by pelvis motion with little shoulder motion, but vice versa in PL subjects. Low-frequency roll motion changed for all groups from mainly shoulder and little pelvis motion to in-phase pelvis and shoulder motion after moving from a firm to foam surface. In contrast, high-frequency roll motion changed from mainly shoulder motion to mainly pelvis motion with the change to a foam surface, except for PL subjects with eyes closed. Coherent low-frequency sway between pelvis and shoulder was only pronounced in VL patients. These results indicate that relative motion between the pelvis and shoulder depends on the support surface, the type of sensory loss, and whether the motion is in roll or pitch plane. Furthermore, relative motion between the pelvis and upper trunk is an integral part of movement modes used to control quiet stance. Vestibular loss patients showed very similar movement modes as controls, with larger amplitudes. Proprioceptive loss patients, however, used more shoulder motion and stabilized the pelvis for the high-frequency mode. We conclude that there is relative motion between the upper trunk and pelvis during quiet stance and suggest that it may contribute to balance control. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Practice of a motor task decreases motor output variability in older adults and is associated with adaptations of discharge activity of single motor units. In this study we were interested in the practice-induced modulation of multiple motor units within 13-30 Hz because theoretically it enhances the timing of active motoneurons. Our purpose, therefore, was to determine the neural adaptation of multiple motor units and related improvements in movement control following practice. Nine healthy older adults (65-85 yr) performed 40 practice trials of a sinusoidal task (0.12 Hz) with their index finger (10° range of motion). Multi-motor unit activity was recorded intramuscularly from the first dorsal interosseus muscle. The mean spike rate (MSR), spike rate variability (CV(ISI)), and frequency modulation (5-60 Hz) of the spike rate were calculated from the multi-motor unit activity and were correlated with movement accuracy and variability of index finger position. A decrease in movement trajectory variability was associated with an increase in MSR (R(2) = 0.58), a decrease in CV(ISI) (R(2) = 0.58), and an increase in total power within a 13- to 30-Hz band (R(2) = 0.48). The increase in total power within a 13- to 30-Hz band was associated significantly (P < 0.005) with an increase in MSR (R(2) = 0.75) and the decrease in CV(ISI) (R(2) = 0.70). We demonstrate that practice-induced improvements in movement control are associated with changes in activity of multiple motor units. These findings suggest that practice-induced improvements in movement steadiness of older adults are associated with changes in the modulation of the motoneuron pool from 13 to 30 Hz.},

abstract = {This paper uses a EMG-driven Hill-type muscle model to estimate individual muscle forces of the triceps surae in isometric plantar flexion contractions. A uniform group of 20 young physical-active adult males was instructed to follow a specific contraction protocol with low (20{\%}MVC) and medium-high (60{\%}MVC) contractions, separated by relaxing intervals. The torque calculated by summing the individual muscle forces multiplied by the respective moment arms was compared to the torque measured by a dynamometer. Musculoskeletal parameters from the literature were used. Then, three different "correction factors" or bias have been applied on some of the muscle model parameters. These factors were based on anthropometric and dynamometric measurements: moment arm scaled by bimalleolar diameter, tendon slack length by leg length and optimal force by the maximum torque. Model torque agreement with dynamometer was recalculated with the parameter scales. It was observed that the relative torque estimation error decreased slightly but significantly when all factors were applied simultaneously (12.92 +/- 4.94{\%} without scaling to 10.12 +/- 1.73{\%}), which resulted mainly from the correction of the maximal muscle force parameter.

The virtual arm incorporates the major muscles spanning the elbow joint and is used to estimate tension developed by individual muscles based on recorded electromyograms (EMGs). It is able to estimate joint moments and the corresponding virtual movements, which are displayed in real-time on a computer screen. In addition, the virtual arm offers artificial control over a variety of physiological and environmental conditions. The virtual arm can be used to examine how the neuromuscular system compensates for the partial or total loss of a muscle's ability to generate force as might result from trauma or pathology.

abstract = {The dorsal side-up body orientation in quadrupeds is maintained by a postural system that is driven by sensory feedback signals. The spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum play essential roles in postural control, whereas the role of the forebrain is unclear. In the present study we investigated whether the motor cortex is involved in maintenance of the dorsal side-up body orientation. We recorded activity of neurons in the motor cortex in awake rabbits while animals maintained balance on a platform periodically tilting in the frontal plane. The tilts evoked postural corrections, i.e., extension of the limbs on the side moving down and flexion on the opposite side. Because of these limb movements, rabbits maintained body orientation close to the dorsal side up. Four classes of efferent neurons were studied: descending corticofugal neurons of layer V (CF5s), those of layer VI (CF6s), corticocortical neurons with ipsilateral projection (CCIs), and those with contralateral projection (CCCs). One class of inhibitory interneurons [suspected inhibitory neurons (SINs)] was also investigated. CF5 neurons and SINs were strongly active during postural corrections. In most of these neurons, a clear-cut modulation of discharge in the rhythm of tilting was observed. This finding suggests that the motor cortex is involved in postural control. In contrast to CF5 neurons, other classes of efferent neurons (CCI, CCC, CF6) were much less active during postural corrections. This suggests that corticocortical interactions, both within a hemisphere (mediated by CCIs) and between hemispheres (mediated by CCCs), as well as corticothalamic interactions via CF6 neurons are not essential for motor coordination during postural corrections.},

abstract = {The distribution of innervation zones was investigated in 3 subjects for 17 muscles and 8 muscle groups in the upper and lower limb, by detecting bi-directional propagation of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) with the multichannel surface electrode array. Clarification of the distribution of innervation zones depended on the ease in detecting the propagation of MUAPs and the actual scattering of innervation zones, which were closely related with muscle morphology with respect to the arrangements of muscle fibers. In muscles having fibers running parallel to each other, such as the biceps brachii, intrinsic hand muscles, vastus lateralis and medialis, tensor fasciae latae, peronei, soleus, tibialis anterior, and hypothenar muscles in the foot, it was relatively easy to detect the propagating MUAPs, and the innervation zones were distributed in a relatively narrow band around muscle belly. On the other hand, in muscles with a complicated structure including pinnation of muscle fibers, in-series muscle fibers and aponeurotic tissues, such as the deltoid, flexors and extensors in the forearm, rectus femoris, sartorius, hamstrings and gastrocnemius, it was more difficult to detect the propagating MUAPs and to identify the innervation zones, which were widely scattered or distributed in complex configurations. The distribution of the innervation zones clarified in the present study can be used to find the optimal location of electrodes in surface EMG recordings and of stimulus electrodes in the functional and therapeutic electrical stimulations. It may also be useful in motor point biopsy for diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases as well as in the botulinum toxin injection for the treatment of spasticity.},

abstract = {The synchronous discharge of neuronal assemblies is thought to facilitate communication between areas within distributed networks in the human brain. This oscillatory activity is especially interesting, given the pathological modulation of specific frequencies in diseases affecting the motor system. Many studies investigating oscillatory activity have focused on same frequency, or linear, coupling between areas of a network. In this study, our aim was to establish a functional architecture in the human motor system responsible for induced responses as measured in normal subjects with magnetoencephalography. Specifically, we looked for evidence for additional nonlinear (between-frequency) coupling among neuronal sources and, in particular, whether nonlinearities were found predominantly in connections within areas (intrinsic), between areas (extrinsic) or both. We modeled the event-related modulation of spectral responses during a simple hand-grip using dynamic casual modeling. We compared models with and without nonlinear connections under conditions of symmetric and asymmetric interhemispheric connectivity. Bayesian model comparison suggested that the task-dependent motor network was asymmetric during right hand movements. Furthermore, it revealed very strong evidence for nonlinear coupling between sources in this distributed network, but interactions among frequencies within a source appeared linear in nature. Our results provide empirical evidence for nonlinear coupling among distributed neuronal sources in the motor system and that these play an important role in modulating spectral responses under normal conditions.},

@article{Heckman1992,
abstract = {1. Two fundamental aspects of the dynamic behavior of motor units of the cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle were measured. Force-velocity (FV) relationships were measured with the use of constant velocity shortening and lengthening movements. Effects of mechanical history were assessed via comparisons of forces immediately after or during slow movements with standard isometric forces. Isometric force-length (FL) relations were also measured, and the effect of different stimulation rates on both FV and FL data was assessed. 2. Prior or concurrent movement greatly potentiated motor-unit force, but this movement potentiation was highly dependent on the amplitude of the unit's force. The smallest twitch forces of type S units (< 10 mN) were potentiated more than threefold, but no potentiation occurred for unit forces > 200 mN. It was tentatively concluded that movement potentiation may play little role in normal movements because it does not occur at forces > 1 {\%} of maximal isometric force of the MG. 3. During shortening, the normalized FV relations of type S units were relatively steeper than those of type FR or FF units. For lengthening, there was no evident relation between FV steepness and motor-unit type. 4. Stimulation rate affected both the FV and FL relationships of the motor units. The peak of the FL relationship (L(o)) clearly shifted to shorter muscle lengths as stimulation rate was increased. The steepness of the FV relationship for shortening was decreased by increasing stimulation rate, but this effect was modest. 5. The shift in motor-unit L(o) and the differences in motor-unit FV relationships were hypothesized to play significant roles during normal motor behavior. Realistic computer simulations of FL and FV functions for a population of motor units undergoing normal steady-state recruitment and rate modulation supported these hypotheses. As the level of simulated neural drive increased, the population L(o) shifted to considerably shorter lengths, and the normalized FV function became much less steep. The significance of these results for models of muscle are discussed.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in muscle force during steady voluntary contractions result from the summation of twitch forces produced by asynchronous activation of multiple motor units. We hypothesized that oscillatory lateral muscle displacement, measured with a non-contact high-resolution laser displacement sensor, is correlated with force fluctuations during steady, voluntary contractions with a human muscle. Eight healthy young adults (20-33 yrs) performed steady isometric contractions with the first dorsal interosseus muscle. Contraction intensity ranged from 2.5{\{}{\%}{\}} to 60{\{}{\%}{\}} of the maximal voluntary contraction force. Oscillatory lateral displacement of the muscle surface was measured with a high-resolution laser displacement sensor (0.5 mu m resolution), concurrently with abduction force of the index finger. In the time-domain analysis, there was a significant positive peak in the cross-correlation function between lateral muscle displacement and force fluctuations. In addition, the amplitude increased linearly with contraction intensity in both signals. In the frequency-domain analysis, frequency content was similar in both signals, and there was significant coherence between signals for the major frequency range of the signals (< 5 Hz). in conclusion, laser-detected lateral displacement of a hand muscle is correlated with force fluctuations across a wide range of contraction intensity during steady voluntary contractions in humans.

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be an autoimmune, inflammatory disease of the CNS. In most patients, the disease follows a relapsing-remitting course and is characterized by dynamic inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the CNS. Although on the surface MS may appear consistent with a primary autoimmune disease, questions have been raised as to whether inflammation and/or autoimmunity are really at the root of the disease, and it has been proposed that MS might in fact be a degenerative disorder. We argue that MS may be an 'immunological convolution' between an underlying primary degenerative disorder and the host's aberrant immune response. To better understand this disease, we might need to consider non-inflammatory primary progressive MS as the 'real' MS, with inflammatory forms reflecting secondary, albeit very important, reactions.},

abstract = {In chronic experiments concerning the activity-dependent plasticity of muscle properties, a simple and noninvasive method was used for monitoring changes of twitch speed in conscious adult cats. The animals had been provided with implanted electrodes for nerve stimulation, and a hand-held force transducer was pressed against the fully extended ankle joint while single test pulses were delivered to the common peroneal nerve. In the present report, this technique for the recording of ankle twitches is subjected to critical analysis and evaluation. The measurements were highly reproducible with respect to contraction time (time-to-peak) but less so for half-relaxation time and twitch amplitude; other methods should be used for the long-term monitoring of contractile force. The total force (torque) of the ankle twitch was mainly produced by tibialis anterior (about 45{\%}), peroneus longus (PerL; 27{\%}) and extensor digitorum longus (23{\%}). The ankle twitch produced by PerL alone had about the same contraction time as that of all the muscles together. Among muscles that had become changed as a result of long-term electrical stimulation there was, in general, a good correspondence between the contraction times from simple external recordings of ankle twitches and those separately measured for PerL under general anesthesia (force transducer then directly connected to PerL tendon).},

We compared quantitatively the usefulness of these features and putative relationships to account for a set of force and length data from cat soleus whole-muscle described in a companion paper. Among the novel features that proved useful were the inclusion of a short-length passive force resisting compression, a new normalisation constant for connective-tissue lengths to replace the potentially troublesome slack length, and a new length dependent term for lengthening velocities in the force-velocity relationship. Each feature of this model was chosen to provide the most accurate description of the data possible without adding unneeded complexity. Previously described functions were compared with novel functions to determine the best description of the experimental data for each of the elements in the model.},

Subjects were instructed to point a laser-attached in line with the upper arm-toward various visual targets, such that two-dimensional (2-D) pointing directions of the upper arm were held constant across different tasks. For each such task, subjects maintained one of several static upper arm-forearm configurations, i. e., each with a set elbow angle and forearm orientation. Upper arm, forearm, and eye orientations were measured with the use of 3-D search coils. The results confirmed that Donders' law (a behavioral restriction of 3-D orientation vectors to a 2-D "surface") does not hold across all pointing tasks, i.e., for a given pointing target, upper arm torsion varied widely. However, for any one static elbow configuration, torsional variance was considerably reduced and was independent of previous arm position, resulting in a thin, Donders-like surface of orientation vectors. More importantly, the shape of this surface (which describes upper arm torsion as a function of its 2-D pointing direction) depended on both elbow angle and forearm orientation. For pointing with the arm fully extended or with the elbow flexed in the horizontal plane, a Listing's-law-like strategy was observed, minimizing shoulder rotations to and from center at the cost of position-dependent tilts in the forearm. In contrast, when the arm was bent in the vertical plane, the surface of best fit showed a Fick-like twist that increased continuously as a function of static elbow flexion, thereby reducing position-dependent tilts of the forearm with respect to gravity. In each case, the torsional variance from these surfaces remained constant, suggesting that Donders' law was obeyed equally well for each task condition. Further experiments established that these kinematic rules were independent of gaze direction and eye orientation, suggesting that Donders' law of the arm does not coordinate with Listing's law for the eye. These results revive the idea that Donders' law is an important governing principle for the control of arm movements but also suggest that its various forms may only be limited manifestations of a more general set of context-dependent kinematic rules. We propose that these rules are implemented by neural velocity commands arising as a function of initial arm orientation and desired pointing direction, calculated such that the torsional orientation of the upper arm is implicitly coordinated with desired forearm posture.},

abstract = {The steady-state motor output, occurring during static force, is characterized by synchronization between oscillatory cortical motor and muscle activity confined to the beta frequency range (15-30 Hz). The functional significance of this beta-range coherence remains unclear. We hypothesized that if the beta-range coherence had a functional role, it would have a behavioral correlate; specifically, it would be related to the precision of the steady-state motor output. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the corticomuscular (EEG-EMG) coherence in eight healthy subjects during steady-state motor output in a visuomotor task, in which the subjects exerted a static force with their right index finger to keep a visual cursor within a target zone. We show that the beta-range EEG-EMG coherence is related to the behavioral performance, i.e. the error signal between target and exerted force. Furthermore, we show that the amplitude of the cortical spectral power is also related to the performance. Moreover, we provide evidence that the EEG-EMG coherence and the cortical spectral power are not completely independent phenomena. Together, our findings indicate that higher beta-range cortical spectral power and increased corticospinal coherence in the beta-range improve motor performance during steady-state motor output. This suggests that the beta-range cortical motor spectral power and corticomuscular coherence may promote effective corticospinal interaction. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When standing quietly, human upright stance is typically approximated as a single segment inverted pendulum. In contrast, investigations which perturb upright stance with support surface translations or visual driving stimuli have shown that the body behaves like a two-segment pendulum, displaying both in-phase and anti-phase patterns between the upper and lower body. Here we present evidence that a single-segment characterization of quiet stance is inadequate. Similar to perturbed stance, quiet stance has simultaneously co-existing in-phase and anti-phase patterns. Subjects stood with eyes closed in three sensory conditions: a fixed surface, a foam surface, and a sway-referenced surface. Spectral analysis showed that the body behaved like a multi-link pendulum with two co-existing modes. The angles of the trunk and leg segments were in-phase for frequencies below 1 Hz and anti-phase for frequencies above 1Hz. The shift from in-phase to anti-phase sway showed an abrupt change for the fixed and foam surfaces, but a gradual change for the sway-referenced condition with the trunk showing a phase lead over the legs. The coexistence of in-phase and anti-phase patterns during quiet stance suggests that the ankle and hip strategies are not extremes along a behavioral continuum of mixed strategies. They are "simultaneously co-existing excitable modes", both always present, but one of which may predominate depending upon the characteristics of the available sensory information, task or perturbation.},

abstract = {Using a signal processing approach, we analyze the line source model for muscle action potential (AP) modeling. We show that the original model presents a tradeoff between violating the Nyquist criterion on one hand and using a discretization frequency that is unnecessarily high with respect to the bandwidth of the generated AP on the other. Here, we present an improved line source model that, compared to the original, allows a lower discretization frequency while retaining the accuracy by simply introducing a continuous-time anti-aliasing filter. Moreover, a transfer function form of the transmembrane current is presented that promote the use of sophisticated signal processing methods on these type of signals. Both continuous-time and discrete-time models are presented. We also address and analyze the implications of the finite length of the muscle fibers. Including this in the model is straightforward, owing to the convolutional form of the line source model, and is manifested by a simple transformation of the associated weighting function. AP modeling is discussed for the three different electrode models: the concentric needle electrode, the single fiber electrode, and the macro electrode. The presented model is suitable for modeling large motor units, where both accuracy and computational efficiency are important factors. To simplify the selection of the discretization interval, we derive what we call the cumulative cutoff frequency that provides an estimate of the required Nyquist frequency.},

abstract = {Spinal motoneurones receive thousands of presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts distributed throughout their dendritic trees. Despite this extensive convergence, there have been very few studies of how synaptic inputs interact in mammalian motoneurones when they are activated concurrently. In the experiments reported here, we measured the effective synaptic currents and the changes in firing rate evoked in cat spinal motoneurones by concurrent repetitive activation of two separate sets of presynaptic neurons. We compared these effects to those predicted by a linear sum of the effects produced by activating each set of presynaptic neurons separately. We generally found that when two inputs were activated concurrently, both the effective synaptic currents and the synaptically-evoked changes in firing rate they produced in motoneurones were generally Linear, or slightly less than the linear sum of the effects produced by activating each input alone. The results suggest that the spatial distribution synaptic terminals on the dendritic trees of motoneurones may help isolate synapses from one another, minimizing non-linear interactions.

Within this framework, the motor command is assumed to be corrupted by signal-dependent noise, which leads to a distribution of possible movements. A task can then be equated with optimizing some function of the statistics of this distribution. We found the optimal trajectory for obstacle avoidance by minimizing the mean-squared error at the end of the movement while keeping the probability of collision with the obstacle below a fixed limit. The optimal paths accurately predicted the empirical trajectories. This demonstrates that controlling the statistics of movements in the presence of signal-dependent noise may be a fundamental and unifying principle of goal-directed movements.},

abstract = {The relations between motor unit global firing rates and established quantitative measures for processing the surface electromyogram (EMG) signals were explored using a simulation approach. Surface EMG signals were simulated using the reported properties of the first dorsal interosseous muscle in man, and the models were varied systematically, using several hypothetical relations between motor unit electrical and force output, and also using different motor unit firing rate strategies. The utility of using different EMG processing parameters to help estimate global motor unit firing rate was evaluated based on their relations to the number of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in the simulated surface EMG signals. Our results indicate that the relation between motor unit electrical and mechanical properties, and the motor unit firing rate scheme are all important factors determining the form of the relation between surface EMG amplitude and motor unit global firing rate. Conversely, these factors have less impact on the relations between turn or zero-crossing point counts and the number of MUAPs in surface EMG. We observed that the number of turn or zero-crossing points tends to saturate with the increase in the MUAP number in surface EMG, limiting the utility of these measures as estimates of MUAP number. The simulation results also indicate that the mean or median frequency of the surface EMG power spectrum is a poor indicator of the global motor unit firing rate.},

abstract = {The present experiment addressed whether increases in corticospinal excitability following sensory stimulation with muscle tendon vibration are accompanied by reorganization of the forearm musculature representation within the primary motor cortex. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we mapped the corticomotor projection to the dominant flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECR) muscle before and after interventional sensory stimulation obtained via muscle tendon vibration (80 Hz, 60 min) to the dominant distal wrist flexor tendons. Following vibration, MEP amplitude at the optimal stimulation position, motor output area, as well as map volume, increased significantly for the ECR. None of these effects reached significance for the FCR. These results suggest that the antagonistic vibratory response (AVR), which is considered to be of cortical origin, induces a delayed facilitation of musculature that is antagonistic to the site of the directly activated la afferent pathways. This example demonstrates that peripheral sensory stimulation can induce lasting increases in corticospinal excitability in the absence of actual movements. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Equilibrium maintenance during standing in humans was investigated with a 3-joint (ankle, knee and hip) sagittal model of body movement. The experimental paradigm consisted of sudden perturbations of humans in quiet stance by backward displacements of the support platform. Data analysis was performed using eigenvectors of motion equation. The results supported three conclusions. First, independent feedback control of movements along eigenvectors (eigenmovements) can adequately describe human postural responses to stance perturbations. This conclusion is consistent with previous observations (Alexandrov et al., 2001b) that these same eigenmovements are also independently controlled in a feed-forward manner during voluntary upper-trunk bending. Second, independent feedback control of each eigenmovement is sufficient to provide its stability. Third, the feedback loop in each eigenmovement can be modeled as a linear visco-elastic spring with delay. Visco-elastic parameters and time-delay values result from the combined contribution of passive visco-elastic mechanisms and sensory systems of different modalities.},

abstract = {The morphological and electrotonic properties of 4 motoneurons, 8 Ia inhibitory interneurons, and 4 Renshaw cells were compared. The morphological analysis, based on 3-D reconstructions of the cells, revealed that dendrites of motoneurons are longer and more extensively branched. Renshaw cells have dendrites that are shorter and simpler in structure. Dendrites of Ia inhibitory interneurons could be as long as those of motoneurons but the branching structure resembled that of Renshaw cells. Compartmental models were used to determine the electrotonic properties of the paths from each dendritic terminal to the soma. The attenuations of steady-state voltage changes in motoneurons were 3 and 7 times larger than in Ia inhibitory interneurons and Renshaw cells, respectively. The same relative order was observed for current attenuation and electrotonic length. The dendritic input resistances in Renshaw cells were 2 and 4 times larger than in Ia inhibitory interneurons and motoneurons, respectively. The difference in these electrotonic properties increased during higher synaptic activity as modeled by a decrease of R-m. The peak amplitudes of voltage transients at sites of brief, synaptic-like changes in conductance were highly dependent on cell class and were largest in Renshaw cells and smallest in motoneurons. In combination with class-specific differences in the attenuation of transient voltage signals, this led to large differences in the peak amplitudes of somatic voltage transients. Differences in the rise times and half-widths of the voltage transients were observed as well. Thus, based on passive properties, each cell class has a unique set of input/output properties.},

abstract = {Reweighting to multisensory inputs adaptively contributes to stable and flexible upright stance control. However, few studies have examined how early a child develops multisensory reweighting ability, or how this ability develops through childhood. The purpose of the study was to characterize a developmental landscape of multisensory reweighting for upright postural control in children 4-10 years of age. Children were presented with simultaneous small-amplitude somatosensory and visual environmental movement at 0.28 and 0.2 Hz, respectively, within five conditions that independently varied the amplitude of the stimuli. The primary measure was body sway amplitude relative to each stimulus: touch gain and vision gain. We found that children can reweight to multisensory inputs from 4 years on. Specifically, intra-modal reweighting was exhibited by children as young as 4 years of age; however, inter-modal reweighting was only observed in the older children. The amount of reweighting increased with age indicating development of a better adaptive ability. Our results rigorously demonstrate the development of simultaneous reweighting to two sensory inputs for postural control in children. The present results provide further evidence that the development of multisensory reweighting contributes to more stable and flexible control of upright stance, which ultimately serves as the foundation for functional behaviors such as locomotion and reaching.},

abstract = {An innovative technique for estimating the shape of the membrane potential trajectory in voluntarily activated human motoneurons is described. This method involves establishing stimulus-induced interval histograms (SIIH) using the H-reflex algorithm, in which the common peroneal nerve was stimulated and the action potentials of voluntarily-activated low-threshold tibialis anterior motor units were recorded using intramuscular wire electrodes. At least two different stimulus intensities were used for each motor unit and SIIHs for both stimuli were established and compared. It is proposed that the position of the mode of a SIIH (as the abscissa) and the amplitude of a given excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or its normalized S value (as the ordinate) can be used to estimate the coordinates of a paint an the average membrane potential trajectory as it approaches the firing threshold. The new estimated average membrane potential trajectory is at variance with the previously suggested linear trajectory. This new trajectory displayed a 'slow depolarization' phase at around 2 mV from the firing threshold. This phase continued for about 20{\%} of the interspike interval (ISI) and was terminated by a rapid depolarization phase, 'subthreshold rectification'. Using this new trajectory, the previously estimated EPSP and IPSP amplitudes can be reexamined where the trajectories were assumed to approach the firing threshold linearly. The new trajectory may help explain the peak that follows an inhibitory reflex, and the difficulty in grading the stimulus intensity for reflex studies.},

However, these are generally not included when using EMG-driven Hill-type muscle models that account for muscle activation dynamics. In this paper, we present a formulation for a one-parameter transformation model (i.e., A-model) that accounts for the type of physiological nonlinearities observed at low levels of force. The general shape for the curvilinear portion of the curve was based on phenomenological data reported by Woods and Bigland-Ritchie. The one-parameter A-model is easy to implement, and when used with an EMG-driven Hill-type model, was shown to provide a better fit of the measured joint moment. Optimization methods were used to determine the appropriate curvature of the relationship for each muscle, and thus introduced a degree of "tuning" to each subject. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Objective: To elucidate the features of sensory nerve involvement in Fisher syndrome (FS), this study extensively investigated sensory electrophysiology. Methods: In 47 consecutive FS patients, results of sensory nerve conduction studies in the median, ulnar and sural nerves, soleus H-reflexes, and median or tibial somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) were reviewed. Because of the large effects of age on amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP), we strictly defined reduction of SNAP amplitudes by using a nomogram which age and amplitude obtained from 87normal subjects. Results: In routine nerve conduction studies, SNAP amplitude was reduced only in 32{\{}{\%}{\}} of the patients, and conduction velocity was decreased in 2{\{}{\%}{\}}. In contrast, soleus H-reflexes were frequently absent or reduced (67{\{}{\%}{\}}). SEPs were abnormal only in 17{\{}{\%}{\}}. Conclusions: In FS, absent soleus H-reflexes are the most frequent electrophysiologic abnormalities, whereas SNAPs amplitudes are rarely affected. The pattern is characterized by predominant involvement of group Ia afferents with relatively preserved cutaneous afferents without evidence suggestive of demyelination. Significance: The major targets of immune attack by anti-GQ1b antibodies in FS appear to be group Ia neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, and this is presumably responsible for ataxia and areflexia in FS. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

Why myelin repair fails in multiple sclerosis is currently unclear; however, new understanding of the generation of oligodendrocytes and myelination during development, as well as an increasing understanding of the bases of successful remyelination, are providing new insights and therapeutic targets. We propose that successful myelin repair of the adult CNS recapitulates a sequence of stages that generally correlate with those seen during development, whereas unsuccessful myelin repair results from the perturbation of a critical process in any one of several sequential events. Defining the rate-limiting steps and most vulnerable aspects at each stage of myelin repair will provide logical targets for therapeutic intervention in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.},

abstract = {This review discusses the role of muscle receptors, in particular, that of muscle spindles, in the detection of movements, both passive and active. Emphasis is placed on the importance of conditioning the muscles acting at a joint before making measurements of thresholds to passive movements, to take into account muscle's thixotropic property. The detection threshold:movement velocity relation is discussed and described for a number of different joints. Implications for muscle spindles are considered from the generalisation that, when expressed in terms of proportion of muscle fascicle length change, detection thresholds are about the same at different joints. It is concluded that the available data supports the view that muscle spindles lie in parallel with only a portion of a muscle fascicle and not the whole fascicle. At the elbow joint, where it has been tested, movement detection threshold is lower during passive movements than during contraction of elbow muscles. Both peripheral mechanisms and mechanisms operating within the central nervous system may be responsible for the rise in threshold. The signalling of movements by spindles during a contraction raises the question of how the central nervous system is able to extract the length signal under such circumstances, given that there is likely to be co-activation of alpha and gamma motoneurones. The evidence for a central subtraction of fusimotor-evoked impulses and some recent experiments relevant to this idea are described. In conclusion, a number of points of uncertainly have been revealed in this area and these should be the subject of future experiments.},

Muscle biopsies were obtained from the gastrocnemius of eight competitive runners ( Run) and eight recreationally active individuals (Rec). Slow-twitch [ myosin heavy chain (MHC) I] and fast- twitch ( MHC IIa) myofibers were isolated and analyzed for diameter (mu m), peak force (P-o; mN), unloaded contraction velocity (V-o; fiber lengths/s), and power. Maximum oxygen uptake was higher (P < 0.05) in Run (71 +/- 1 vs. 47 +/- 2 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)). Diameter of MHC I and MHC IIa fibers from Run subjects was similar to 20{\{}{\%}{\}} greater (P < 0.05) than Rec. Peak force of the MHC IIa fibers was 31{\{}{\%}{\}} higher (P < 0.05) in Run, whereas Po of MHC I fibers was not different between groups. No differences for specific tension (P-o/cross-sectional area) were present between groups for either fiber type. Vo was higher (P < 0.05) in MHC I (+70{\{}{\%}{\}}) and MHC IIa (+18{\{}{\%}{\}}) fibers from Run subjects. In vitro peak absolute power (mu N center dot s(-1)) of both fiber types was greater (P < 0.05) in Run (131 and 85{\{}{\%}{\}} for MHC I and MHC IIa, respectively). Additionally, normalized power (W/1) of the MHC I fibers was 64{\{}{\%}{\}} higher in Run, whereas no differences were noted for normalized power of MHC IIa fibers. These data indicate that highly trained endurance runners have elevated contraction velocity in both slow- and fast-twitch myofibers. These characteristics of the fast- twitch muscle fibers have not been previously reported in competitive endurance athletes and may contribute to the high level of running performance in these athletes.},

Joint stiffness can be separated into intrinsic stiffness and reflex stiffness, which are modeled as a linear system and a LNL system, respectively. With a compliant load, joint stiffness can be viewed as being operated in closed-loop because the torque is fed back through the load to change the position. In this paper, we present a new method to estimate the intrinsic and reflex stiffness from the total torque measurement. An EIV (Errors-In-Variables) subspace system identification method is used to estimate the dynamics of each pathway directly from measured data.

abstract = {This study aimed to analyse the dynamic properties of the muscle spindle feedback system of shoulder muscles during a posture task. External continuous force disturbances were applied at the hand while subjects had to minimize their hand displacements. The results were analysed using two frequency response functions (FRFs) from which the model parameters were derived, being 1) the mechanical admittance and 2) the reflexive impedance. These FRFs were analysed by a neuromusculoskeletal model that implicitly separates the reflexive feedback properties (position, velocity and acceleration feedback gains) from intrinsic muscle visco-elasticity. The results show substantial changes in estimated reflex gains under conditions of variable bandwidth of the applied force disturbance or variable degrees of external damping. Position and velocity feedback gains were relatively larger when the force disturbance contained only low frequencies. With increasing damping of the environment, acceleration feedback gain decreased, velocity feedback gain remained almost constant and position feedback gain increased. It is concluded that under the aforementioned circumstances, the reflex system increases its gains to maximize the mechanical resistance to external force disturbances while preserving sufficient stability.},

abstract = {To expand our studies on accommodation in human motor nerve axons, the effects of temperature on polarizing nodal and internodal electrotonic potentials and their current kinetics are investigated. The computations use our temperature dependent multi-layered model of the myelinated human motor nerve fiber and the temperature is increased from 20°C to 42°C. The results show that for temperatures from 28°C to 37°C, the polarizing electrotonic potentials almost coincide, as the kinetics of their ionic currents is changed a little. The normal (at 37°C) resting membrane potential is further depolarized or hyperpolarized during hypothermia (≤ 25°C) or hyperthermia (≥ 40°C), respectively and its change is determined by the flow of ionic currents through the internodal axolemma during the polarizing current stimuli. The polarizing electrotonic potentials are more altered during hypothermia and are most altered during hyperthermia. During hyperthermia, the depolarizing nodal and internodal electrotonic potentials are determined by the nodal slow (I Ks ) and internodal fast (I Kf ) and slow (I Ks ) potassium currents. The hyperpolarizing internodal electrotonic potentials are determined by the activation of internodal channels, which are different during hyperthermia at 40°C and 42°C. These potentials are determined by the internodal I Ks current at 40°C and by the internodal inward rectifier (I IR ) and leakage (I Lk ) currents at 42°C. The difference in accommodation to hyperpolarizing currents during focal and uniform hyperthermia at 42°C is discussed. The present results are essential for the interpretation of mechanisms of threshold electrotonus measurements in subjects with symptoms of cooling, warming and fever, which can result from alterations in body temperature.},

abstract = {1. In standing subjects, an ankle-dorsiflexing perturbation of the supporting surface evokes a short-latency response (SLR) and a medium-latency response (MLR) to stretch in both soleus (Sol) and flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles. The SLR is the counterpart of the monosynaptic reflex, whilst the MLR might be either mediated by Ia fibres, the delay being due to a long-loop central circuit, or by fibres of slower conduction velocity Since small afferents are slowed more than large ones by low temperature, a greater latency increment for the MLR than the SLR induced by cooling of the limb would point to a peripheral origin of the MLR. 2. In nine subjects, one limb was cooled by circulating water in a tube wrapped around it for about 120 min. Perturbations were delivered to the same limb prior to and during cooling, and after rewarming. EMG was recorded by surface electrodes from the Sol and FDB muscles. 3. The mean increase in latency of MLRs was significantly greater than that of SLRs in both muscles. On average, the Sol SLR increased from 42.4 to 47.0 ms and the Sol MLR from 72.0 to 82.3 ms. The FDB SLR increased from 58.1 to 66.5 ms and the FDB MLR from 94.9 to 110.5 ms. The mean difference (MLR minus SLR) increased from 29.6 to 35.2 ms for Sol, and from 36.8 to 43.9 ms for FDB at the end of cooling. After 30 min of rewarming, the responses of both muscles recovered towards control values. 4. The greater latency increment of the MLRs than of the SLRs favours the hypothesis of a slower conduction velocity of the responsible afferent fibres. The most likely candidate fibres are the spindle group II afferents.},

abstract = {The statistical analysis of two simultaneously observed trains of neuronal spikes is described, using as a conceptual framework the theory of stochastic point processes.The first statistical question that arises is whether the observed trains are independent; statistical techniques for testing independence are developed around the notion that, under the null hypothesis, the times of spike occurrence in one train represent random instants in time with respect to the other. If the null hypothesis is rejected-if dependence is attributed to the trains-the problem then becomes that of characterizing the nature and source of the observed dependencies. Statistical signs of various classes of dependencies, including direct interaction and shared input, are discussed and illustrated through computer simulations of interacting neurons. The effects of nonstationarities on the statistical measures for simultaneous spike trains are also discussed. For two-train comparisons of irregularly discharging nerve cells, moderate nonstationarities are shown to have little effect on the detection of interactions.Combining repetitive stimulation and simultaneous recording of spike trains from two (or more) neurons yields additional clues as to possible modes of interaction among the monitored neurons; the theory presented is illustrated by an application to experimentally obtained data from auditory neurons.A companion paper covers the analysis of single spike trains.},

H reflexes were evoked in the ECR by stimulating the radial nerve above the elbow. A conditioning stimulus was applied to the median nerve above the elbow to assess presynaptic inhibition of homonymous Ia afferents (D1 inhibition) or at the wrist (palmar branch) to assess the ongoing presynaptic inhibition of heteronymous Ia afferents that converge onto the ECR motor neuron pool (heteronymous Ia facilitation). The young adults had less D1 inhibition and greater heteronymous Ia facilitation during the position task (79 and 132.1{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively) compared with the force task (69.1 and 115.1{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively, P < 0.05). In contrast, the old adults exhibited no difference between the two tasks for either D1 inhibition ( approximately 72{\{}{\%}{\}}) or heteronymous Ia facilitation ( approximately 114{\{}{\%}{\}}). Contraction intensity did not influence the amount of D1 inhibition or heteronymous Ia facilitation for either group of subjects. The amount of antagonist coactivation was similar between tasks for young adults, whereas it was greater in the position task for old adults (P = 0.02). These data indicate that in contrast to young adults, old adults did not modulate presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents when controlling the position of a compliant load but rather increased coactivation of the antagonist muscle.},

abstract = {In the present study, we investigated the modulation pattern of the soleus H reflex in healthy subjects in response to imposed static and dynamic changes in body angle, referenced to the vertical plane. Soleus H reflexes were recorded using conventional methods with subjects either supine or while they were erect. Changes in body angle were initiated with subjects lying supine on a tilt table. Table position was controlled via a motor and could move from the horizontal to the upright position and beyond. Elastic bands around the trunk (upper and lower part) and around the thigh and shank secured subjects' position. In the vertical position, the soleus H reflex exhibited a strong depression in all subjects tested, reaching amplitudes as low as 40+/-8.1{\{}{\%}{\}} of the control reflex (Ho). With subjects supine, positioning the body at 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 40 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, -50 degrees and -20 degrees all resulted in a significant facilitation of the soleus H reflex. The reflex magnitude at these angles ranged from 140+/-17.2{\{}{\%}{\}} to 180+/-10.9{\{}{\%}{\}} of the Ho. Reflex facilitation was also observed following dynamic tilt of the body in the sagittal plane (at 1.8 degrees /s) with the H reflex reaching amplitudes as high as 300+/-18.3{\{}{\%}{\}} of Ho. Our findings indicate that changes in body orientation induced a significant facilitation of the H reflex magnitude in soleus motoneurones that were essentially independent of angular change in body orientation or of movement direction. In addition, they highlight the potent modulatory effects that natural stimulation of the vestibular system can have on reflex excitability. The implications of our findings are discussed in relation to the maintenance of body posture.},

@article{Baker1998,
abstract = {When the spikes of a motor cortical cell are used to compile a spike-triggered average (STA) of rectified electromyographic (EMG) activity, a post-spike facilitation (PSF) is sometimes seen. This is generally thought to be. indicative of direct corticomotoneuronal (CM) connections. However, it has been claimed that a PSF could be caused by synchronization between CM and non-CM cells. This study investigates the generation of PSF using a computer model. A population of cortical cells was simulated, some of which made CM connections to a pool of 103 motoneurons. Motoneurons were simulated using a biophysically realistic model. A subpopulation of the cortical cells was synchronized together. After a motoneuron discharge, a motor unit action potential was generated; these were summed to produce an EMG output. Realistic values were used for the corticospinal and peripheral nerve conduction velocity distribution, for slowing of impulse conduction in CM terminal axons, and for the amount of cortical synchrony. STA of the rectified EMG from all cortical neurons showed PSF; however, these were qualitatively different for CM versus non-CM cells. Using an epoch analysis to determine reliability in a quantitative manner, it was shown that the onset latency of PSF did not distinguish the two classes of cells after 10,000 spikes because of high noise in the averages. The time of the PSF peak and the peak width at half-maximum (PWHM) could separate CM from synchrony effects. However, only PWHM was robust against changes in motor unit action-potential shape and duration and against changes in the width of cortical synchrony. The amplitude of PSF from a CM cell could be doubled by the presence of synchrony. It is proposed that, if a PSF has PWHM <7 ms, this reliably indicates that the trigger is a CM cell projecting to the muscle whose EMG is averaged. In an analysis of experimental data where macaque motor cortical cells facilitated hand and forearm muscle EMG, 74{\%} of PSFs fulfilled this criterion. The PWHM criterion could be applied to other STA studies in which it is important to exclude the effects of synchrony.},

abstract = {We developed a physiologically realistic mathematical model of the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) whose elements correspond to anatomical features of the biological receptor. The mechanical interactions of these elements enable it to capture all salient aspects of GTO afferent behavior reported in the literature. The model accurately describes the GTO's static and dynamic responses to activation of single motor units whose muscle fibers insert into the GTO, including the different static and dynamic sensitivities that exist for different types of muscle fibers (S, FR, and FF). Furthermore, it captures the phenomena of self- and cross-adaptation wherein the GTO dynamic response during motor unit activation is reduced by prior activation of the same or a different motor unit, respectively. The model demonstrates various degrees of nonlinear summation of GTO responses resulting from simultaneous activation of multiple motor units. Similarly to the biological GTO, the model suggests that the activation of every additional motor unit to already active motor units that influence the receptor will have a progressively weaker incremental effect on the GTO afferent activity. Finally, the proportional relationship between the cross-adaptation and summation recorded for various pairs of motor units was captured by the model, but only by incorporating a particular type of occlusion between multiple transduction regions that were previously suggested. This occlusion mechanism is consistent with the anatomy of the afferent innervation and its arrangement with respect to the collagen strands inserting into the GTO.},

abstract = {As a part of the aging process, motor unit reorganization occurs in which small motoneurons reinnervate predominantly fast-twitch muscle fibers that have lost their innervation. We examined the relationship between motor unit size and the threshold force for recruitment in two muscles to determine whether older individuals might develop an alternative pattern of motor unit activation. Young and older adults performed isometric contractions ranging from 0 to 50{\%} of maximal voluntary contraction in both the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Muscle fiber action potentials were recorded with an intramuscular needle electrode and motor unit size was computed using spike-triggered averaging of the global EMG signal (macro EMG), which was also obtained from the intramuscular needle electrode. As expected, older individuals exhibited larger motor units than young subjects in both the FDI and the TA. However, moderately strong correlations were obtained for the macro EMG amplitude versus recruitment threshold relationship in both the young and older adults within both muscles, suggesting that the size principle of motor unit recruitment seems to be preserved in older adults.},

abstract = {Tremor imposes an important limit to the accuracy of fine movements in healthy individuals and can be a disabling feature of neurological disease. Voluntary slow finger movements are not smooth but are characterized by large discontinuities (i.e., steps) in the tremor frequency range (approximately 10 Hz). Previous studies have shown that these discontinuities are coherent with activity in the primary motor cortex (M1), but that other brain areas are probably also involved. We investigated the contribution of three important subcortical areas in two macaque monkeys trained to perform slow finger movements. Local field potential and single-unit activity were recorded from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), medial pontomedullary reticular formation, and the intermediate zone of the spinal cord (SC). Coherence between LFP and acceleration was significant at 6 to 13 Hz for all areas, confirming the highly distributed nature of the central network responsible for this activity. The coherence phase at 6 to 13 Hz for DCN and pontomedullary reticular formation was similar to our previous results in M1. By contrast, for SC the phase differed from M1 by approximately p rad. Examination of single-unit discharge confirmed that this was a genuine difference in neural spiking and could not be explained by different properties of the local field potential. Convergence of antiphase oscillations from the SC with cortical and subcortical descending inputs will lead to cancellation of approximately 10 Hz oscillations at the motoneuronal level. This could appreciably limit drive to muscle at this frequency, thereby reducing tremor and improving movement precision.},

Spike trains were obtained from computer simulations based on a threshold-crossing model of tonically firing MN, subjected to stimulation producing postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) of various parameters. These trains were analyzed as experimental results, using the output measures that were previously shown to be most effective for this purpose: peristimulus time histogram, raster plot and peristimulus time intervalgram. The analysis started from the effects of single excitatory and inhibitory PSPs (EPSPs and IPSPs). The conclusions drawn from this analysis allowed the explanation of the results of more complex synaptic volleys, i.e., combinations of EPSPs and IPSPs, and the formulation of directions for decoding the results of human neurophysiological experiments in which the responses of tonically firing MNs to nerve stimulation are analyzed.},

abstract = {Despite similar computational approaches, there is surprisingly little interaction between the computational neuroscience and the systems biology research communities. In this review I reconstruct the history of the two disciplines and show that this may explain why they grew up apart. The separation is a pity, as both fields can learn quite a bit from each other. Several examples are given, covering sociological, software technical, and methodological aspects. Systems biology is a better organized community which is very effective at sharing resources, while computational neuroscience has more experience in multiscale modeling and the analysis of information processing by biological systems. Finally, I speculate about how the relationship between the two fields may evolve in the near future.},

abstract = {The first part of this review deals with arguments that the essential properties and organization of spinal interneuronal systems in the cat and in man are similar. The second part is concerned with the possibility that some interneuronal systems may be responsible for motor disturbances caused by spina: cord injuries and that these interneurones may be defined. This possibility is discussed with respect to the hyperexcitability of alpha-motorneurones and the exaggeration of stretch reflexes in spastic patients. To this end, what is known about cat spinal interneurones and about the neuronal basis and pharmacological treatment of spasticity, is put together. Interneurones in di- and trisynaptic reflex pathways from group II muscle afferents are singled out, since they are depressed by the a, noradrenaline receptor agonists clonidine and tizanidine, which is a critical feature of interneurones expected to contribute to exaggerated stretch reflexes which are reduced by a, noradrenaline receptor agonists. Recent observations that reflex excitation of extensor motoneurones from group II afferents is enhanced in spastic patients and that the pathologically strong reflex actions of group II afferents are reduced by clonidine and tizanidine support this proposal. On the other hand, a lack of effect of clonidine and tizanidine upon other types of excitatory or inhibitory interneurones argues against any major contribution of such interneurones to the abnormally strong responses of alpha-motoneurones to muscle stretch.

abstract = {Neurons recruited for local computations exhibit rhythmic activity at gamma frequencies. The amplitude and frequency of these oscillations are continuously modulated depending on stimulus and behavioral state. This modulation is believed to crucially control information flow across cortical areas. Here we report that in the rat hippocampus gamma oscillation amplitude and frequency vary rapidly, from one cycle to the next. Strikingly, the amplitude of one oscillation predicts the interval to the next. Using in??vivo and in??vitro whole-cell recordings, we identify the underlying mechanism. We show that cycle-by-cycle fluctuations in amplitude reflect changes in synaptic excitation spanning over an order of magnitude. Despite these rapid variations, synaptic excitation is immediately and proportionally counterbalanced by inhibition. These rapid adjustments in inhibition instantaneously modulate oscillation frequency. So, by rapidly balancing excitation with inhibition, the hippocampal network is able to swiftly modulate gamma oscillations over a wide band of frequencies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is a pure motor axonal subtype of Guillain-Barr?? syndrome (GBS) that was identified in the late 1990s. In Asia and Central and South America, it is the major subtype of GBS, seen in 30-65{\%} of patients. AMAN progresses more rapidly and has an earlier peak than demyelinating GBS; tendon reflexes are relatively preserved or even exaggerated, and autonomic dysfunction is rare. One of the main causes is molecular mimicry of human gangliosides by Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides. In addition to axonal degeneration, electrophysiology shows rapidly reversible nerve conduction blockade or slowing, presumably due to pathological changes at the nodes or paranodes. Autoantibodies that bind to GM1 or GD1a gangliosides at the nodes of Ranvier activate complement and disrupt sodium-channel clusters and axoglial junctions, which leads to nerve conduction failure and muscle weakness. Improved understanding of the disease mechanism and pathophysiology might lead to new treatment options and improve the outlook for patients with AMAN. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Isolated fibers were teased from the proximal, intermediate, and distal regions of the muscle. Endplates of distal fibers were located on the proximal third of their lengths. Endplates of intermediate fibers were located at half fiber length, and for proximal fibers, a variable endplate position was obtained: in half of the muscles studied, endplates occurred around the proximal one-third and in the other half near the midpoint of the fiber. Endplate position relative to fiber length was thus found to be dependent on the region of the muscle. Changes in the orientation of endplate zone relative to the muscle belly is likely to take place with changes in muscle length, as shown by a planimetric muscle model. It is argued that architecture of pennate muscles may highly affect characteristics of motor unit potentials.},

Modern attempts to improve human performance utilize this phenomenon. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether performance improvement by addition of optimum noise (ON) is related to increased cortical motor spectral power (SP) and increased corticomuscular coherence. Eight subjects performed a visuomotor task requiring to compensate with the right index finger a static force (SF) generated by a manipulandum on which Gaussian noise was applied. The finger position was displayed on-line on a monitor as a small white dot which the subjects had to maintain in the center of a green bigger circle. Electroencephalogram from the contralateral motor area, electromyogram from active muscles and finger position were recorded. The performance was measured by the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the white dot from the zero position. ON compared to the zero noise condition induced an improvement in motor accuracy together with an enhancement of cortical motor SP and corticomuscular coherence in beta-range. These data suggest that the improved sensorimotor performance via SR is consistent with an increase in the cortical motor SP and in the corticomuscular coherence.},

abstract = {The tongue plays a key role in various volitional and automatic functions such as swallowing, maintenance of airway patency, and speech. Precisely how hypoglossal motor neurons, which control the tongue, receive and process their often concurrent input drives is a subject of ongoing research. We investigated common synaptic input to the hypoglossal motor nucleus by measuring the coordination of spike timing, firing rate, and oscillatory activity across motor units recorded from unilateral (i.e., within a belly) or bilateral (i.e., across both bellies) locations within the genioglossus (GG), the primary protruder muscle of the tongue. Simultaneously recorded pairs of motor units were obtained from 14 healthy adult volunteers using tungsten microelectrodes inserted percutaneously into the GG while the subjects were engaged in volitional tongue protrusion or rest breathing. Bilateral motor unit pairs showed concurrent low frequency alterations in firing rate (common drive) with no significant difference between tasks. Unilateral motor unit pairs showed significantly stronger common drive in the protrusion task compared with rest breathing, as well as higher indices of synchronous spiking (short-term synchrony). Common oscillatory input was assessed using coherence analysis and was observed in all conditions for frequencies up to ∼ 5 Hz. Coherence at frequencies up to ∼ 10 Hz was strongest in motor unit pairs recorded from the same GG belly in tongue protrusion. Taken together, our results suggest that cortical drive increases motor unit coordination within but not across GG bellies, while input drive during rest breathing is distributed uniformly to both bellies of the muscle.},

The present paper describes a MLR in soleus evoked by stimulating the deep peroneal nerve, documents its characteristics and addresses its likely origin. The MLR of soleus was recorded in healthy subjects and hemiplegic patients, following electrical stimulation of the deep peroneal nerve at the fibula at rest, during voluntary dorsiflexion, during plantar flexion, during external restraint to the ankle dorsiflexion movement, during limb cooling, during limb ischaemia and 1 h after the ingestion of tizanidine. The dorsiflexion movement of the foot was measured using an accelerometer. During cooling, ischaemia and after tizanidine, changes in the MLR were compared with changes in the soleus H reflex, Achilles tendon reflex and, during cooling, F waves of abductor hallucis. The MLR was facilitated by voluntary dorsiflexion, was suppressed during plantar flexion, disappeared when ankle movement was prevented, and was enhanced in patients with spastic hemiplegia. Cooling delayed the MLR significantly more than the Achilles tendon reflex and the abductor hallucis F wave. During ischaemia the response was significantly less affected than the Achilles tendon reflex and the soleus H reflex. Tizanidine suppressed the MLR, but not the soleus H and tendon reflexes. The latencies and the experiments using cooling, ischaemia and tizanidine implicate soleus group II afferents in the genesis of this response.},

abstract = {Rodents use their whiskers to sense their surroundings. As most of the information available to the somatosensory system originates in whiskers' primary afferents, it is essential to understand the transformation of whisker motion into neuronal activity. Here, we combined in vivo recordings in anesthetized rats with mathematical modeling to ascertain the mechanical and electrical characteristics of mechanotransduction. We found that only two synergistic processes, which reflect the dynamic interactions between (1) receptor and whisker and (2) receptor and surrounding tissue, are needed to describe mechanotransduction during passive whiskers deflection. Interactions between these processes may account for stimulus-dependent changes in the magnitude and temporal pattern of tactile responses on multiple scales. Thus, we are able to explain complex electromechanical processes underlying sensory transduction using a simple model, which captures the responses of a wide range of mechanoreceptor types to diverse sensory stimuli. This compact and precise model allows for a ubiquitous description of how mechanoreceptors encode tactile stimulus.},

abstract = {Regulation by negative feedback is fundamental to engineering and biological processes. Biological regulation is usually explained using continuous feedback models from both classical and modern control theory. An alternative control paradigm, intermittent control, has also been suggested as a model for biological control systems, particularly those involving the central nervous system. However, at present, there is no identification method explicitly formulated to distinguish intermittent from continuous control; here, we present such a method. The identification experiment uses a special paired-step set-point sequence. The corresponding data analysis use a conventional ARMA model to relate a theoretically derived equivalent set-point to control signal; the novelty lies in sequentially and iteratively adjusting the timing of the steps of this equivalent set-point to optimize the linear time-invariant fit. The method was verified using realistic simulation data and was found to robustly distinguish not only between continuous and intermittent control but also between event-driven intermittent and clock-driven intermittent control. When applied to human pursuit tracking, event-driven intermittent control was identified, with an intermittent interval of 260-310 ms (n = 6, p < 0.05). This new identification method is applicable for machine and biological applications.},

abstract = {This brief review discusses the methods used to estimate the neural drive to muscles from the surface electromyogram (EMG). Surface EMG has been classically used to infer the neural activation of muscle by associating its amplitude with the number of action potentials discharged by a population of motor neurons. Although this approach is valuable in some applications, the amplitude of the surface EMG is only a crude indicator of the neural drive to muscle. More advanced methods are now available to estimate the neural drive to muscle from the surface EMG. These approaches identify the discharge times of a few motor units by decomposing the EMG signal to determine the relative changes in neural activation. This approach is reliable in several conditions and muscles for isometric contractions of moderate force, but is limited to the few superficial units that can be identified in the recordings.

abstract = {This paper reviews data acquisition and signal processing issues relative to producing an amplitude estimate of surface EMG. The paper covers two principle areas. First. methods for reducing noise, artefact and interference in recorded EMG are described. Wherever possible noise should be reduced at the source via appropriate skin preparation, and the use of well designed active electrodes and signal recording instrumentation. Despite these efforts, some noise will always accompany the desired signal, thus signal processing techniques for noise reduction (e.g. band-pass filtering, adaptive noise cancellation filters and filters based on the wavelet transform) are discussed. Second, methods for estimating the amplitude of the EMG are reviewed. Most advanced, high fidelity methods consist of six sequential stages: noise rejection/filtering, whitening, multiple-channel combination, amplitude demodulation, smoothing and relinearization. Theoretical and experimental research related to each of the above topics is reviewed and the current recommended practices are described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All lights reserved.},

Motoneurons of human lower limb muscles exhibit sustained, submaximal activity to high-frequency electrical trains, which has been hypothesized to be partly triggered by monosynaptic Ia afferents. The possibility to trigger such behavior in upper limb motoneurons and the potential unique role of Ia afferents to trigger such behavior remain unclear. Subjects (n = 9) received high-frequency trains of electrical stimuli over biceps brachii and flexor pollicis longus (FPL). We chose to study the FPL muscle because it has weak monosynaptic Ia afferent connectivity and it is involved in fine motor control of the thumb. Two types of stimulus trains (100-Hz bursts and triangular ramps) were tested at five intensities below painful levels. All subjects exhibited enhanced torque in biceps and FPL muscles after both types of high-frequency train. Torques also persisted after stimulation, particularly for the highest stimulus intensity. To separate the evoked torques that resulted from a peripheral mechanism (e. g., muscle potentiation) and that which resulted from a central origin, we studied FPL responses to high-frequency trains after complete combined nerve blocks of the median and radial nerves (n = 2). During the blocks, high-frequency trains over the FPL did not yield torque enhancements or persisting torques. These results suggest that enhanced contractions of central origin can be elicited in motoneurons innervating the upper limb, despite weak monosynaptic Ia connections for FPL. Their presence in a recently evolved human muscle (FPL) indicates that these enhanced contractions may have a broad role in controlling tonic postural outputs of hand muscles and that they may be available even for fine motor activities involving the thumb.},

abstract = {The influence of the muscle length on the distribution of muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) was estimated at 3 different elbow angles (90 degrees, 120 degrees and 150 degrees) during the contraction of 30{\%} of isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Surface electromyogram was recorded in the distal region of m. biceps brachii using a surface array electrode. MFCVs at the different locations from the end-plate to the distal tendon of the muscle were measured directly using the averaging method. MFCVs near the end-plate and the distal tendon of the muscle showed the high values, while MFCVs in the middle region between the end-plate and the distal tendon of the muscle had low values at the same elbow angles. The mean MFCVs in the middle region decreased when the muscle length increased during the contraction of 30{\%} MVC. The middle region length changed when the elbow joint was extended from the elbow angle of 90 degrees to that of 150 degrees. Although previous studies showed the influence of muscle length on MFCV for special regions (like end-plate, tendon, and middle region), MFCV for whole regions, that is, the distribution of MFCV has not been studied for various muscle length. The MFCV for the same region in the some muscle length could not be estimated. In the study, the distribution of MFCV in various muscle length for the contraction of 30{\%} MVC was obtained, and the model with the function including muscle length for the estimation of MFCV was presented.},

abstract = {1. The objective of this study was to determine which afferents contribute to the medium latency response of the soleus stretch reflex resulting from an unexpected perturbation during human walking. 2. Fourteen healthy subjects walked on a treadmill at approximately 3.5 km h(-1) with the left ankle attached to a portable stretching device. The soleus stretch reflex was elicited by applying small amplitude (approximately 8 deg) dorsiflexion perturbations 200 ms after heel contact. 3. Short and medium latency responses were observed with latencies of 55 +/- 5 and 78 +/- 6 ms, respectively. The short latency response was velocity sensitive (P < 0.001), while the medium latency response was not (P = 0.725). 4. Nerve cooling increased the delay of the medium latency component to a greater extent than that of the short latency component (P < 0.005). 5. Ischaemia strongly decreased the short latency component (P = 0.004), whereas the medium latency component was unchanged (P = 0.437). 6. Two hours after the ingestion of tizanidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist known to selectively depress the transmission in the group II afferent pathway, the medium latency reflex was strongly depressed (P = 0.007), whereas the short latency component was unchanged (P = 0.653). 7. An ankle block with lidocaine hydrochloride was performed to suppress the cutaneous afferents of the foot and ankle. Neither the short (P = 0.453) nor medium (P = 0.310) latency reflexes were changed. 8. Our results support the hypothesis that, during walking the medium latency component of the stretch reflex resulting from an unexpected perturbation is contributed to by group II muscle afferents.},

There is interest in whether these changes are reflected in the organisation of the cerebral motor system in older subjects and whether such changes might be in some way compensatory. Most studies in humans have used functional brain imaging techniques to compare motor system activation in younger and older subjects. Interpretation of these results is made more difficult by potential neurovascular changes in older subjects. However, in general, there appears to be greater motor task-related brain activity in a wider network of brain regions in older compared to younger subjects. The evidence that these changes are compensatory in nature is less clear. Incorporation of behavioural and anatomical data will be required in order to fully interpret the functional imaging results.

Maximal voluntary force (MVC), maximal motor unit firing rate, and motoneuron AHP duration were measured on two occasions. The training group participated in six dorsiflexor exercise training sessions between test and retest. At baseline, young subjects had higher MVC force and maximal motor unit firing rate, and shorter AHP duration, compared with older subjects. Young and older subjects in the trained group demonstrated a respective 17.4{\%} and 19.8{\%} increase in MVC force, a 6.8{\%} and 24.3{\%} increase in maximal MUFR, and a 7.4{\%} and 14.2{\%} decrease in AHP duration.

abstract = {Orientation of the body with respect to gravity is based on integration of visual, vestibular and somatosensory signals. Here, we investigated the subjective postural vertical (SPV) and visual vertical (SVV) in three patients with bilateral somatosensory deafferentation and a group of age-matched normal subjects. Our hypothesis was that the patients with bilateral somatosensory deafferentation may show tilt induced bias in the construction of their SPV, with a normal SVV. Patient 1 had a severe Guillain Barr{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} syndrome and almost complete absence of peripheral sensation, the two other patients had a thoracic spinal injury with a sensory loss from T6-7 down. On initial testing, compared with normal subjects and the patients with spinal injury, Patient 1 had a significant bias in SPV towards the side of a preceding tilt in both directions. Several months later, after significant improvement of sensation, this tilt-induced bias in SPV had resolved completely. In addition, Patient 1 had a significantly enlarged "cone of verticality", which did not change following improvement in peripheral sensation, reflecting persisting disturbance in the perception of body verticality. In the two patients with spinal injury, bias towards the side of a preceding tilt was not significant. These findings confirm the importance of somatosensory input from the trunk to the perception of SPV in the seated position. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The force-length relation of the SEC was determined in dynamometer experiments on the same four subjects, Length of the CC was calculated as total muscle-tendon length minus the force dependent length of the SEC. The measured relations between force and length or velocity were compared with the individually determined force-length and force-velocity relations of the CC. In walking or running the negative work performed in the eccentric phase was completely stored as elastic energy. This elastic energy was released in the concentric phase, at speeds well exceeding the maximum shortening speed predicted by the Hill force-velocity relation. Speed of the CC, in contrast, was positive and low, well within the range predicted by the measured force-velocity properties and compatible with a favourable muscular efficiency. These effects were also present in purely concentric contractions, like the squatted jump. Contractile component length usually started at the far end of the force-length relation, Inter-individual differences in series-elastic stiffness were reflected in the force and length recordings during natural activity.},

abstract = {Oscillatory common inputs of cortical or peripheral origin can be identified from the motor neuron output with linear analysis methods. Linear transmission is possible despite the motor neuron non-linearity because the same input is sent commonly to several neurons. Because of the linear transmission, common input components to motor neurons can be investigated from the surface EMG, for example by EEG-EMG or EMG-EMG coherence. In these studies, there is an open debate on the utility and appropriateness of EMG rectification. The present study addresses this issue by an analytical, simulation and experimental approach. The main novel theoretical contribution that we report is that both the spectra of the rectified and of the raw EMG contain input spectral components to motor neurons. However, they differ by the contribution of amplitude cancellation which influences the rectified EMG spectrum when extracting common oscillatory inputs. Therefore, the degree of amplitude cancellation has an impact on the effectiveness of EMG rectification in extracting input spectral peaks. The theoretical predictions were exactly confirmed by realistic simulations of a pool of motor neurons innervating a muscle in a cylindrical volume conductor of EMG generation and by experiments conducted on the first dorsal interosseous and the abductor pollicis brevis muscles of seven healthy subjects during pinching. It was concluded that when the contraction level is relatively low, EMG rectification may be preferable for identifying common inputs to motor neurons, especially when the energy of the action potentials in the low frequency range is low. Nonetheless, different levels of cancellation across conditions influence the relative estimates of the degree of linear transmission of oscillatory inputs to motor neurons when using the rectified EMG.},

The maximal strain of the Achilles tendon and aponeurosis, estimated separately from the elongation data, was 5.1 +/- 1.1 and 5.9 +/- 1.6{\%}, respectively. There was no significant difference in strain between the Achilles tendon and aponeurosis.

We designed a multipurpose system to assess the variability and reproducibility of isometric torque measurements obtained during maximal voluntary efforts of the knee flexor, knee extensor, ankle dorsiflexor, and ankle plantarflexor muscles on each side. It used two isometric myographs mounted on an adjustable frame. Measurements of maximal voluntary torque (range, 25-188 Nm) displayed low variability within a testing session and over five testing sessions (coefficient of variation range, 5-11 {\{}{\%}{\}}). We used the same equipment to measure voluntary activation of the triceps surae muscles. Voluntary activation, measured with a sensitive twitch interpolation method, increased with increasing voluntary contraction torque (P < 0.001) and was very high during maximal efforts (mean, 97.8 +/- 2.1{\{}{\%}{\}}; median, 98.5{\{}{\%}{\}}). Furthermore, measurements of voluntary activation during maximal efforts were reproducible across testing sessions with very little variability (coefficient of variation, <2{\{}{\%}{\}}).

@article{Enriquez-Denton2002,
abstract = {It has been demonstrated in man that the H-reflex is more depressed by presynaptic inhibition than the stretch reflex. Here we investigated this finding further in the alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cat. Soleus monosynaptic reflexes were evoked by electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve or by stretch of the triceps surae muscle. Conditioning stimulation of the posterior biceps and semitendinosus nerve (PBSt) produced a significantly stronger depression of the electrically than the mechanically evoked reflexes. The depression of the reflexes has been shown to be caused by presynaptic inhibition of triceps surae Ia afferents. We investigated the hypothesis that repetitive activation of peripheral afferents may reduce their sensitivity to presynaptic inhibition. In triceps surae motoneurones, we measured the effect of presynaptic inhibition on excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produced by repetitive activation of the peripheral afferents or by fast and slow muscle stretch. EPSPs evoked by single electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve or by fast muscle stretch were significantly depressed by PBSt stimulation. However, the last EPSP in a series of EPSPs evoked by a train of electrical stimuli (5-6 shocks, 150-200 Hz) was significantly less depressed by the conditioning stimulation than the first EPSP. In addition, the last part of the long-lasting EPSPs evoked by a slow muscle stretch was also less depressed than the first part. A single EPSP evoked by stimulation of the medial gastrocnemius nerve was less depressed when preceded by a train of stimuli applied to the same nerve than when the same train of stimuli was applied to a synergistic nerve. The decreased sensitivity of the test EPSP to presynaptic inhibition was maximal when it was evoked within 20 ms after the train of EPSPs. It was not observed at intervals longer than 30 ms. These findings suggest that afferent activity may decrease the efficiency of presynaptic inhibition. We propose that the described interaction between afferent nerve activity and presynaptic inhibition may partly explain why electrically and mechanically evoked reflexes are differently sensitive to presynaptic inhibition.},

abstract = {1. Steady-state inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were evoked in tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus motoneurons of the cat by using tendon vibration to activate Ia-afferent fibers from the antagonist medial gastrocnemium muscle. 2. The effective synaptic currents (I(N)) underlying the steady-state IPSPs were measured by the use of a modified voltage-clamp technique. The amplitudes of the effective synaptic currents (1.62 +/- 0.66 nA, mean +/- SD; n = 20) extended over a fivefold range (0.5 - 2.7 nA) but were not correlated with the intrinsic properties of the motoneurons or with putative motor unit type. 3. We calculated the synaptic conductance (G(S)) underlying the steady-state Ia IPSPs from measurements of motoneuron input conductance during the activation of the Ia synaptic input. As was expected from Ohm's law, the Ia-inhibitory G(S) and I(N) were correlated (r = 0.49; P < 0.05). Like I(N), G(S) (175 +/- 202 nS, mean +/- SD; n = 20) was not correlated with the intrinsic properties of the motoneurons. 4. As has been reported previously for transient Ia IPSPs, the amplitudes of the steady-state IPSPs were correlated with motoneuron input resistance (r = 0.74; P < 0.001) and homonymous Ia excitatory postsynaptic synaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude (r = 0.72; P < 0.001). 5. The amplitudes of the steady-state Ia IPSPs and the homonymous Ia EPSPs were plotted on logarithmic axes. The slope (0.59) was significantly < 1, which indicates that the gradient of Ia inhibition across the motoneuron pool is less steep than that of Ia excitation. This difference can be ascribed to the distributions of the effective synaptic currents generated by these two input systems: the I(N) underlying homonymous Ia EPSPs covaries with the intrinsic properties of the motoneurons, whereas the I(N) underlying reciprocal Ia IPSPs does not.},

abstract = {Inspiratory muscles training in COPD is controversial not only in relation to the load level required to produce muscular conditioning effects but also in relation to the group of patients benefiting from the training. Consequently, inspiratory muscular response assessment during Threshold (R) therapy may help optimizing training strategy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the participation of the diaphragm and the sternocleidomastoid (SMM) muscle to overcome with a 30{\%} Threshold (R) load using surface electromyography (sEMG) and to analyze the correlation between SNIM activation, maximum strength level of inspiratory muscles (MIP) and obstruction degree in COPD patients (FEV1). We studied seven healthy elderly subjects, mean age of 68 4 years and seven COPD patients, FEV1 45 +/- 17{\%} of the predicted value, with mean age 66 8 years. sEMG analysis of SMM muscles and diaphragm were obtained through RMS (root-mean-square) during three stages: pre-loading, loading and post-loading. Results: In the COPD group, the RMS of the SMM increased 28{\%} during load (p < 0.05) while the RMS of the diaphragm remained constant. In the elderly there was a trend of a 11{\%} increase in diaphragm activity and of 7{\%} in SMM activity but, without reaching significance levels. SMM activity demonstrated good correlation with the obstruction level (r = -0.537). Conclusion: To overcome the load required by Threshold (R) therapy, COPD patients demonstrated an increase of accessory muscles activity.. represented by SMM. For the same relative load this increase seems to be proportional to the degree of pulmonary obstruction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The efficacy of evoked ACh release by intact and newly sprouted terminals in response to partial denervation and expansion of the motor neuron terminal field was studied in mouse soleus muscle after section of the L-5 spinal root. From 2 to 4 d after partial denervation until 90 d later, only 3-7 motor units of the normal 21 remained. Regeneration of the dissected nerve was prevented while the remaining motor units were sprouting. The indirect twitch, which was only 20{\%} of direct twitch tension 2-4 d after nerve section, recovered between 28 and 50 d postoperatively. However, the depression of twitch in low Ca/high Mg solution, which was equal to control 2-3 d postoperatively, was 2-3 times more depressed than control by 50 d and remained so up to 90 d. This indicated persistent reduction of the safety factor in sprouted motor units. Intracellular measurement of quantal content in 0.4 mM Ca, 2.75 mM Mg revealed 2 groups of nerve terminals in partially denervated muscle. The quantal content of the first group was greater than contralateral control at earlier times (28-50 d) and only slightly greater than control later (74 and 90 d). This group consisted of the original undenervated terminals, since it was associated with normal miniature endplate potential (MEPP) frequency and end-plate potential (EPP) latency, and presumably with the class of fibers with normal (zinc iodide osmium-stained) nerve terminal morphology and occasional large myelinated preterminal axons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We argue that both stiffness control [Winter, D. A., Patla, A. E., Riedtyk, S., {\{}{\&}{\}} Ishac, M. (2001). Ankle muscle stiffness in the control of balance during quiet standing. Journal of Neurophysiology, 85, 2630-2633] and continuous feedback control by means of a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) mechanism [Peterka, R. J. (2000). Postural control model interpretation of stabilogram diffusion analysis. Biological Cybernetics, 83, 335-343.] can guarantee asymptotic stability of controlled posture at the expense of unrealistic assumptions: the level of intrinsic muscle stiffness in the former case, and the level of background noise in the latter, which also determines an unrealistic level of jerkiness in the sway. We show that the decomposition of the control action into a slow and a fast component (rambling and trembling, respectively, as proposed by [Zatsiorsky, V. M., {\{}{\&}{\}} Duarte, M. (1999).

Rambling and trembling in quiet standing. Motor Control, 4, 185-200.]) is useful but must be modified in order to take into account that rambling is not a stable equilibrium trajectory. We address the possibility of a form of stability weaker than asymptotic stability in light of the intermittent stabilization mechanism outlined by [Loram, I. D., {\{}{\&}{\}} Lakie, M. (2002a). Human balancing of an inverted pendulum: position control by small, ballistic-like, throw and catch movements.

This indicator provides a further argument against the plausibility of PID-like control mechanisms. Finally, we draw attention to the sliding mode control theory that provides a useful theoretical framework for formulating realistic intermittent, stabilization models.},

abstract = {Weakness and fatigue are commonly encountered symptoms in neurological disorders and significantly impair quality of life. In the case of motor axons, conduction block contributes to weakness and fatigue and may be associated with aberrant nerve activity including fasciculations and cramp. These symptoms result from dysfunction of the constituent channels and pumps of the axonal membrane. In critically conducting axons, impulse conduction can be impaired by the effects of activity or by other mechanisms that produce a significant shift in membrane potential. Conduction failure may be accentuated or relieved by maneuvers that manipulate the time course of the driving current, including the administration of agents that interfere with Na(+) channel function. In patients with inflammatory neuropathies, normal activity may be sufficient to precipitate conduction failure at sites of impaired function in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). From a clinical perspective, these features are not assessed adequately by conventional neurophysiological techniques. As weakness and fatigue may only develop following activity or exertion, it is useful to assess the effects of impulse trains to determine the extent of conduction failure and the resulting symptoms in neurological patients. These techniques and the physiological mechanisms underlying the development of activity-dependent hyperpolarization will be critically appraised in this review, with a focus on demyelinating neuropathies, MMN and the neurodegenerative disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).},

abstract = {To identify the mechanisms responsible for the fluctuations in force that occur during voluntary contractions, experimental measurements were compared with simulated forces in the time and frequency domains at contraction intensities that ranged from 2 to 98{\%} of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The abduction force exerted by the index finger due to an isometric contraction of the first dorsal interosseus muscle was measured in 10 young adults. Force was simulated with computer models of motor-unit recruitment and rate coding for a population of 120 motor units. The models varied recruitment and rate-coding properties of the motor units and the activation pattern of the motor-unit population. The main finding was that the experimental observations of a minimum in the coefficient of variation (CV) for force (1.7{\%}) at approximately 30{\%} MVC and a plateau at higher forces could not be replicated by any of the models. The model that increased the level of short-term synchrony with excitatory drive provided the closest fit to the experimentally observed relation between the CV for force and the mean force. In addition, the results for the synchronization model extended previous modeling efforts to show that the effect of synchronization is independent from that of discharge-rate variability. Most of the power in the force power spectra for the models was contained in the frequency bins below 5 Hz. Only a model that included a low-frequency oscillation in excitation, however, could approximate the experimental finding of peak power at a frequency below 2 Hz: 38{\%} of total power at 0.99 Hz and 43{\%} at 1.37 Hz, respectively. In contrast to the experimental power spectra, all model spectra included a second peak at a higher frequency. The secondary peak was less prominent in the synchronization model because of greater variability in discharge rate. These results indicate that the variation in force fluctuations across the entire operating range of the muscle cannot be explained by a single mechanism that influences the output of the motor-unit population.},

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism of breakdown of accommodation, which at present is unknown. RESULTS: A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce breakdown of accommodation when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. CONCLUSION: The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in breakdown of accommodation, and that breakdown of accommodation can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions.},

If such a process implementation were feasible, it could be used as an indicator to reduce the chances of work-place injury. This research report on the effectiveness of the wavelet transform applied to the EMG signal as a means of identifying muscle fatigue.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last few years much research has been devoted to investigating the synchronization between cortical motor and muscular activity as measured by EEG/MEG-EMG coherence. The main focus so far has been on corticomuscular coherence (CMC) during static force condition, for which coherence in beta-range has been described. In contrast, we showed in a recent study 1 that dynamic force condition is accompanied by gamma-range CMC. The modulation of the CMC by various dynamic force amplitudes, however, remained uninvestigated. The present study addresses this question. We examined eight healthy human subjects. EEG and surface EMG were recorded simultaneously. The visuomotor task consisted in isometric compensation for 3 forces (static, small and large dynamic) generated by a manipulandum. The CMC, the cortical EEG spectral power (SP), the EMG SP and the errors in motor performance (as the difference between target and exerted force) were analyzed. RESULTS: For the static force condition we found the well-documented, significant beta-range CMC (15-30 Hz) over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Gamma-band CMC (30-45 Hz) occurred in both small and large dynamic force conditions without any significant difference between both conditions. Although in some subjects beta-range CMC was observed during both dynamic force conditions no significant difference between conditions could be detected. With respect to the motor performance, the lowest errors were obtained in the static force condition and the highest ones in the dynamic condition with large amplitude. However, when we normalized the magnitude of the errors to the amplitude of the applied force (relative errors) no significant difference between both dynamic conditions was observed. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that during dynamic force output the corticomuscular network oscillates at gamma frequencies. Moreover, we show that amplitude modulation of dynamic force has no effect on the gamma CMC in the low force range investigated. We suggest that gamma CMC is rather associated with the internal state of the sensorimotor system as supported by the unchanged relative error between both dynamic conditions.},

abstract = {A large number of experiments have asked to what degree human reaching movements can be understood as being close to optimal in a statistical sense. However, little is known about whether these principles are relevant for other classes of movements. Here we analyzed movement in a task that is similar to surfing or snowboarding. Human subjects stand on a force plate that measures their center of pressure. This center of pressure affects the acceleration of a cursor that is displayed in a noisy fashion (as a cloud of dots) on a projection screen while the subject is incentivized to keep the cursor close to a fixed position. We find that salient aspects of observed behavior are well-described by optimal control models where a Bayesian estimation model (Kalman filter) is combined with an optimal controller (either a Linear-Quadratic-Regulator or Bang-bang controller). We find evidence that subjects integrate information over time taking into account uncertainty. However, behavior in this continuous steering task appears to be a highly non-linear function of the visual feedback. While the nervous system appears to implement Bayes-like mechanisms for a full-body, dynamic task, it may additionally take into account the specific costs and constraints of the task.},

@article{Gawthrop2011a,
abstract = {The paradigm of continuous control using internal models has advanced understanding of human motor control. However, this paradigm ignores some aspects of human control, including intermittent feedback, serial ballistic control, triggered responses and refractory periods. It is shown that event-driven intermittent control provides a framework to explain the behaviour of the human operator under a wider range of conditions than continuous control. Continuous control is included as a special case, but sampling, system matched hold, an intermittent predictor and an event trigger allow serial open-loop trajectories using intermittent feedback. The implementation here may be described as "continuous observation, intermittent action". Beyond explaining unimodal regulation distributions in common with continuous control, these features naturally explain refractoriness and bimodal stabilisation distributions observed in double stimulus tracking experiments and quiet standing, respectively. Moreover, given that human control systems contain significant time delays, a biological-cybernetic rationale favours intermittent over continuous control: intermittent predictive control is computationally less demanding than continuous predictive control. A standard continuous-time predictive control model of the human operator is used as the underlying design method for an event-driven intermittent controller. It is shown that when event thresholds are small and sampling is regular, the intermittent controller can masquerade as the underlying continuous-time controller and thus, under these conditions, the continuous-time and intermittent controller cannot be distinguished. This explains why the intermittent control hypothesis is consistent with the continuous control hypothesis for certain experimental conditions.},

@article{Bui2006,
abstract = {In the presence of neuromodulators such as serotonin and noradrenaline, motoneurons exhibit persistent inward currents (PICs) that serve to amplify synaptic inputs. A major component of these PICs is mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels. Estimates based on electrophysiological studies indicate that these channels are located on the dendrites, but immunohistochemical studies of their precise distribution have yielded different results. Our goal was to determine the distribution of these channels using computational methods. A theoretical analysis of the activation of PICs by a somatic current injection in the absence or presence of synaptic activity suggests that L-type Ca2+ channels may be segregated to discrete hot spots 25-200 mu m long and centered 100-400 mu m from the soma in the dendritic tree. Compartmental models based on detailed anatomical measurements of the structure of feline neck motoneurons with L-type Ca2+ channels incorporated in these regions produced plateau potentials resulting from PIC activation. Furthermore, we replicated the experimental observation that the somatic threshold at which PICs were activated was depolarized by tonic activation of inhibitory synapses and hyperpolarized by tonic activation of excitatory synapses. Models with L-type Ca2+ channels distributed uniformly were unable to replicate the change in somatic threshold of PIC activation. Therefore we conclude that the set of L-type Ca2+ channels mediating plateau potentials is restricted to discrete regions in the dendritic tree. Furthermore, this distribution leads to the compartmentalization of the dendritic tree of motoneurons into subunits whose sequential activation lead to the graded amplification of synaptic inputs.},

Taken together with previous reports that both pathways are facilitated in the TA at the early stance phase of human walking, our findings suggest that a common neural mechanism underlies both observations, one that might be functionally relevant for securing ankle joint stabilization during upright standing.},

abstract = {Extra forces or torques are defined as forces or torques that are larger than would be expected from the input or stimuli, which can be mediated by properties intrinsic to motoneurons and/or to the muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine whether extra forces/torques evoked during electrical stimulation of the muscle or its nerve with variable frequency stimulation are modulated by muscle length/joint angle. A secondary aim was to determine whether extra forces/torques are generated by an intrinsic neuronal or muscle property. Experiments were conducted in 14 able-bodied human subjects and in eight adult decerebrate cats. Torque and force were measured in human and cat experiments, respectively. Extra forces/torques were evoked by stimulating muscles with surface electrodes (human experiments) or by stimulating the nerve with cuff electrodes (cat experiments). In humans and cats, extra forces/torques were larger at short muscle lengths, indicating that a similar regulatory mechanism is involved. In decerebrate cats, extra forces and length-dependent modulation were unaffected by intrathecal methoxamine injections, despite evidence of increased spinal excitability, and by transecting the sciatic nerve proximal to the nerve stimulations. Anesthetic nerve block experiments in two human subjects also failed to abolish extra torques and the length-dependent modulation. Therefore, these data indicate that extra forces/torques evoked during electrical stimulation of the muscle or nerve are muscle length-dependent and primarily mediated by an intrinsic muscle property.},

abstract = {This study characterizes tonic and phasic stretch reflex and stiffness and viscosity changes associated with spastic hemiparesis. Perturbations were applied to the ankle of 27 hemiparetic and 36 healthy subjects under relaxed or active contracting conditions. A nonlinear delay differential equation model characterized phasic and tonic stretch reflex gains, elastic stiffness, and viscous damping. Tendon reflex was characterized with reflex gain and threshold. Reflexively, tonic reflex gain was increased in spastic ankles at rest (P < 0.038) and was not regulated with muscle contraction, indicating impaired tonic stretch reflex. Phasic-reflex gain in spastic plantar flexors was higher and increased faster with plantar flexor contraction (P < 0.012) than controls (P < 0.023) and higher in dorsi-flexors at lower torques (P < 0.038), primarily because of its increase at rest (P = 0.045), indicating exaggerated phasic stretch reflex especially in more spastic plantar flexors, which showed higher phasic stretch reflex gain than dorsi-flexors (P < 0.032). Spasticity was associated with increased tendon reflex gain (P = 0.002) and decreased threshold (P < 0.001). Mechanically, stiffness in spastic ankles was higher than that in controls across plantar flexion/dorsi-flexion torque levels (P < 0.032), and the more spastic plantar flexors were stiffer than dorsi-flexors at comparable torques (P < 0.031). Increased stiffness in spastic ankles was mainly due to passive stiffness increase (P < 0.001), indicating increased connective tissues/shortened fascicles. Viscous damping in spastic ankles was increased across the plantar flexion torque levels and at lower dorsi-flexion torques, reflecting increased passive viscous damping (P = 0.033). The more spastic plantar flexors showed higher viscous damping than dorsi-flexors at comparable torque levels (P < 0.047). Simultaneous characterizations of reflex and nonreflex changes in spastic hemiparesis may help to evaluate and treat them more effectively.},

Evidence from more than three decades of combined psychophysical and neurophysiological research supports the idea that each afferent type serves a distinctly different sensory function and that these functions explain most of tactual perceptual function. The available evidence supports the following hypotheses: (1) The slowly adapting type 1 system provides the information on which form and texture perception are based. (2) The cutaneous rapidly adapting system provides information about minute skin motion and, thereby, plays a critical role in grip control. (3) The Pacinian system is responsible for the detection and perception of distant events by vibrations transmitted through objects, probes, and tools held in the hand. (4) The slowly adapting type 2 system provides information for the perception of hand conformation and for the perception of forces acting on the hand. The authors review the evidence on which these hypotheses are based. They also review the role of proprioceptive afferents in the perception of hand conformation because they appear to play a significant role along with cutaneous afferents.},

A Langevin equation with delay and a random-walk model whose transition probability depends on a fixed time-interval past (delayed random walk model) are the subjects of in depth focus. As well as considering relations between these two types of models, we derive an approximate Fokker-Planck equation for delayed stochastic systems and compare its solution with numerical results.},

abstract = {We used multi-channel surface electromyograms (EMGs) to examine if electrode location influences coherence measures derived from pairs of EMGs recorded from two hand muscles during a pinch task. A linear probe of 16 electrodes was used to estimate the location of the innervation zone in first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB). Four electrodes were then placed on the skin overlying each muscle and three bipolar electrode configurations were constructed with their center points directly over the innervation zone, and 15mm distal and proximal to the innervation zone. Ten subjects performed two force-matching tasks for 120s at 2N and 3.5N by pressing a force sensor held between the thumb and index finger. Coherence spectra were calculated from pairs of EMGs recorded from the two muscles. Maximal coherence from 1 to 15Hz and 16 to 32Hz was calculated at both force levels from the EMGs with electrodes centered over the innervation zones of FDI and APB. These values were compared to the maximal coherence from all other EMG comparisons across muscles recorded with electrodes that avoided the innervation zones. ANOVA revealed significant main effects only for electrode location, with a 58.1{\{}{\%}{\}} increase (p=0.001) in maximal coherence for EMGs detected from pairs of electrodes that avoided the innervation zone (from 0.11+/-0.02 to 0.18+/-0.03; mean+/-95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval). These results indicate that electrode location relative to the innervation zone influences EMG-EMG coherence and should be carefully considered when placing EMG electrodes on hand muscles.},

abstract = {During human standing, tonic ankle extensor torque is required to support the centre of mass (CoM) forward of the ankles, and dynamic torque modulation is required to maintain unstable balance. Passive mechanisms contribute to both but the extent is controversial. Some groups have revealed a substantial intrinsic stiffness (65-90{\%}) normalized to load stiffness, 'mgh' Others regard their methodology as unsuitable for the low-frequency conditions of quiet standing and believe the passive contribution to be small (10-15{\%}). Here we applied low-frequency ankle rotations to upright subjects who were supported at the waist allowing the leg muscles to be passive and we report normalized stiffness. The passive calf muscles provided: (i) an extensor torque capable of sustaining unstable balance without tonic activity at a mean CoM-ankle angle of 1.6 deg, (ii) a long range stiffness of 13 +/- 2{\%} and (iii) a short range I(< 0.2 deg) stiffness of 67 +/- 8{\%}. Chordal ankle stiffness, derived from the torque versus angle relationship for 7 deg rotations, shows a non-linear decrease (stiffness a rotation(-0.33 +/- 0.04)) from 101 +/- 9{\%} to 19 +/- 5{\%} for rotations of 0.03-7 deg, respectively. Thus, passive stiffness is well adapted for the continuum of postural and movement activity and has a substantial postural role eliminating the need for continuous muscle activity and increasing the unstable time constant of the human inverted pendulum. Ignoring the non-linear dependence of passive stiffness on sway size could lead to serious misinterpretation of experiments using perturbations and sensory manipulations such as eye closure, sway referencing and altered support surfaces.},

@article{VanderKooij2001,
abstract = {An adaptive estimator model of human spatial orientation is presented. The adaptive model dynamically weights sensory error signals. More specific, the model weights the difference between expected and actual sensory signals as a function of environmental conditions. The model does not require any changes in model parameters. Differences with existing models of spatial orientation are that: (1) environmental conditions are not specified but estimated, (2) the sensor noise characteristics are the only parameters supplied by the model designer, (3) history-dependent effects and mental resources can be modelled, and (4) vestibular thresholds are not included in the model; instead vestibular-related threshold effects are predicted by the model. The model was applied to human stance control and evaluated with results of a visually induced sway experiment. From these experiments it is known that the amplitude of visually induced sway reaches a saturation level as the stimulus level increases. This saturation level is higher when the support base is sway referenced. For subjects experiencing vestibular loss, these saturation effects do not occur. Unknown sensory noise characteristics were found by matching model predictions with these experimental results. Using only five model parameters, far more than five data points were successfully predicted. Model predictions showed that both the saturation levels are vestibular related since removal of the vestibular organs in the model removed the saturation effects, as was also shown in the experiments. It seems that the nature of these vestibular-related threshold effects is not physical, since in the model no threshold is included. The model results suggest that vestibular-related thresholds are the result of the processing of noisy sensory and motor output signals. Model analysis suggests that, especially for slow and small movements, the environment postural orientation can not be estimated optimally, which causes sensory illusions. The model also confirms the experimental finding that postural orientation is history dependent and can be shaped by instruction or mental knowledge. In addition the model predicts that: (1) vestibular-loss patients cannot handle sensory conflicting situations and will fall down, (2) during sinusoidal support-base translations vestibular function is needed to prevent falling, (3) loss of somatosensory information from the feet results in larger postural sway for sinusoidal support-base translations, and (4) loss of vestibular function results in falling for large support-base rotations with the eyes closed. These predictions are in agreement with experimental results.},

abstract = {Different species maintain a particular body orientation in space (upright in humans, dorsal-side-up in quadrupeds, fish and lamprey) due to the activity of a closed-loop postural control system. We will discuss operation of spinal and supraspinal postural networks studied in a lower vertebrate (lamprey) and in two mammals (rabbit and cat). In the lamprey, the postural control system is driven by vestibular input. The key role in the postural network belongs to the reticulospinal (RS) neurons. Due to vestibular input, deviation from the stabilized body orientation in any (roll, pitch, yaw) plane leads to generation of RS commands, which are sent to the spinal cord and cause postural correction. For each of the planes, there are two groups of RS neurons responding to rotation in the opposite directions; they cause a turn opposite to the initial one. The command transmitted by an individual RS neuron causes the motor response, which contributes to the correction of posture. In each plane, the postural system stabilizes the orientation at which the antagonistic vestibular reflexes compensate for each other. Thus, in lamprey the supraspinal networks play a crucial role in stabilization of body orientation, and the function of the spinal networks is transformation of supraspinal commands into the motor pattern of postural corrections. In terrestrial quadrupeds, the postural system stabilizing the trunk orientation in the transversal plane was analyzed. It consists of two relatively independent sub-systems stabilizing orientation of the anterior and posterior parts of the trunk. They are driven by somatosensory input from limb mechanoreceptors. Each sub-system consists of two closed-loop mechanisms - spinal and spino-supraspinal. Operation of the supraspinal networks was studied by recording the posture-related activity of corticospinal neurons. The postural capacity of spinal networks was evaluated in animals with lesions to the spinal cord. Relative contribution of spinal and supraspinal mechanisms to the stabilization of trunk orientation is discussed.},

abstract = {Two architectures of intermittent control are compared and contrasted in the context of the single inverted pendulum model often used for describing standing in humans. The architectures are similar insofar as they use periods of open-loop control punctuated by switching events when crossing a switching surface to keep the system state trajectories close to trajectories leading to equilibrium. The architectures differ in two significant ways. Firstly, in one case, the open-loop control trajectory is generated by a system-matched hold, and in the other case, the open-loop control signal is zero. Secondly, prediction is used in one case but not the other. The former difference is examined in this paper. The zero control alternative leads to periodic oscillations associated with limit cycles; whereas the system-matched control alternative gives trajectories (including homoclinic orbits) which contain the equilibrium point and do not have oscillatory behaviour. Despite this difference in behaviour, it is further shown that behaviour can appear similar when either the system is perturbed by additive noise or the system-matched trajectory generation is perturbed. The purpose of the research is to come to a common approach for understanding the theoretical properties of the two alternatives with the twin aims of choosing which provides the best explanation of current experimental data (which may not, by itself, distinguish beween the two alternatives) and suggesting future experiments to distinguish beween the two alternatives.},

abstract = {The relationship between the size of the soleus (Sol) Hoffmann (H-) reflex and the level of background (BG) electromyographic (EMG) activity was examined during plantarflexing at different force levels. The experiments were carried out on seven healthy male subjects aged 20-37 years. The subjects were asked to perform fast plantartlexion under a reaction-time condition. The amounts of contraction force were 10, 20, 50 and 80{\%} of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Since the maximum size of the M-wave (Mmax) changed systematically during the plantarflexion, we tried to maintain the size of the reference M-wave, an indicator of the efficiency of the electrical stimulation, at a constant value (20{\%} of Mmax) throughout the experiment. The size of the H-reflex was rapidly increased at the very beginning of the movement, and then it tended to decrease in the later phase of the movement. Consequently, even with the same level of BG EMG, the size of the H-reflex was always larger in the early rising phase of the EMG activity than in the later falling phase. The maximum size of the H-reflex was poorly correlated with the force exerted. In contrast, the size of the F-response was proportional to the force exerted. The non-linear relationship between the size of the H-reflex and the BG EMG suggests that the level of the presynaptic inhibition onto la terminals was modified depending on the required force level and during the course of the movement.

abstract = {Electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings obtained using intracranially implanted electrodes in epilepsy patients indicate that high gamma band (HGB) activity of sensorimotor cortex is focally increased during voluntary movement. These movement related HGB modulations may play an important role in sensorimotor cortex function. It is however currently not clear to what extent this type of neural activity can be detected using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) and how similar HGB responses in healthy human subjects are to those observed in epilepsy patients. Using the same arm reaching task, we have investigated spectral power changes both in intracranial ECoG recordings in epilepsy patients and in non-invasive EEG recordings optimized for detecting HGB activity in healthy subjects. Our results show a common HGB response pattern both in ECoG and EEG recorded above the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the side of arm movement. In both cases, HGB activity increased around movement onset in the 60-90??Hz range and became most pronounced at reaching movement end. Additionally, we found EEG HGB activity above the frontal midline possibly generated by the anterior supplementary motor area (SMA), a region that was however not covered by the intracranial electrodes used in the present study. In summary, our findings show that HGB activity from human sensorimotor cortex can be non-invasively detected in healthy subjects using EEG, opening a new perspective for investigating the role of high gamma range neuronal activity both in function and dysfunction of the human cortical sensorimotor network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The limbs of running mammals are thought to function as inverted struts. When mammals run at constant speed, the ground reaction force vector appears to be directed near the point of rotation of the limb on the body such that there is little or no moment at the joint. If this is true, little or no external work is done at the proximal joints during constant-speed running. This possibility has important implications to the energetics of running and to the coupling of lung ventilation to the locomotor cycle. To test if the forelimb functions as an inverted strut at the shoulder during constant-speed running and to characterize the locomotor function of extrinsic muscles of the forelimb, we monitored changes in the recruitment of six muscles that span the shoulder (the m. pectoralis superficialis descendens, m. pectoralis profundus, m. latissimus dorsi, m. omotransversarius, m. cleidobrachialis and m. trapezius) to controlled manipulations of locomotor forces and moments in trotting dogs (Canis lupus familiaris Linnaeus 1753). Muscle activity was monitored while the dogs trotted at moderate speed (approximately 2 m s(-1)) on a motorized treadmill. Locomotor forces were modified by (1) adding mass to the trunk, (2) inclining the treadmill so that the dogs ran up- and downhill (3) adding mass to the wrists or (4) applying horizontally directed force to the trunk through a leash. When the dogs trotted at constant speed on a level treadmill, the primary protractor muscles of the forelimb exhibited activity during the last part of the ipsilateral support phase and the beginning of swing phase, a pattern that is consistent with the initiation of swing phase but not with active protraction of the limb during the beginning of support phase. Results of the force manipulations were also consistent with the protractor muscles initiating swing phase and contributing to active braking via production of a protractor moment on the forelimb when the dogs decelerate. A similar situation appears to be true for the major retractor muscles of the forelimb. The m. pectoralis profundus and the m. latissimus dorsi were completely silent during the support phase of the ipsilateral limb when the dogs ran unencumbered and exhibited little or no increase in activity when the dogs carried added mass on their backs to increase any retraction torque during the support phase of constant-speed running. The most likely explanation for these observations is that the ground force reaction vector is oriented very close to the fulcrum of the forelimb such that the forelimb functions as a compliant strut at the shoulder when dogs trot at constant speed on level surfaces. Because the moments at the fulcrum of the pectoral girdle appear to be small during the support phase of a trotting step, a case can be made that it is the activity of the extrinsic appendicular muscles that produce the swing phase of the forelimb that explain the coupled phase relationship between ventilatory airflow and the locomotor cycle in trotting dogs.},

abstract = {The dynamics of networks of sparsely connected excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons are studied analytically. The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed.},

abstract = {The patterns of neuronal activity can be different even if the mean firing rate is fixed. Investigating the variability of the firing may not be sufficient and we suggest to take into account the notion of randomness. The randomness is related to the entropy of the firing, which is bounded from above by the entropy of the Poisson process (given the mean interspike interval). Thus, we propose the Kullback-Leibler distance with respect to the Poisson process. as a measure of randomness in a stationary neuronal activity. Under the condition of equal mean values the KL distance does not depend on the time scale and therefore can be compared to the coefficient of variation employed to measure the variability. Furthermore, this measure can be, extended to, account for correlated neuronal firing. Finally, we analyze the variability and randomness for three common ISI distributions in detail: gamma, lognormal and inverse Gaussian. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: During isometric compensation of modulated low-level forces corticomuscular coherence (CMC) has been shown to occur in high-beta or gamma-range. The influence of the frequency of force modulation on CMC has up to now remained unexplored. We addressed this question by investigating CMC, motor performance, and cortical spectral power during a visuomotor task in which subjects had to compensate a modulated force of 8{\%} of the maximum voluntary contraction exerted on their right index finger. The effect of three frequencies of force modulation (0.6, 1.0 and 1.6 Hz) was tested. EEG, EMG from first dorsal interosseus, hand flexor and extensor muscles, and finger position were recorded in eight right-handed women. RESULTS: Five subjects showed CMC in gamma- (28-45 Hz) and three in beta-range (15-30 Hz). Beta- and gamma-range CMC and cortical motor spectral power were not modulated by the various frequencies. However, a sharp bilateral CMC peak at 1.6 Hz was observed, but only in the five gamma-range CMC subjects. The performance error increased linearly with the frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the frequency of force modulation has no effect on the beta- and gamma-range CMC during isometric compensation for modulated forces at 8{\%} MVC. The beta- and gamma-range CMC may be related to interindividual differences and possibly to strategy differences.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general outline of the mathematical basis of an approach for analysis of population synchrony by means of coherence computations, a demonstration of the use of this approach, and a discussion of the potential utility and limitations of the approach. The coherence function for the pair single-unit activity and population-aggregate activity is studied in the light of theoretical considerations on the superposition of partially correlated unitary activities. The theoretical analysis, as well as computer simulations, indicate that when a subset of units in a population are correlated around some frequency, the unit-to-aggregate coherence function for members of this subset shows, in a wide range of conditions, a clear peak around that frequency (and possibly harmonic peaks), being very low at other frequencies where there is no synchrony. Specifically, the value of the peak coherence at the frequency of synchrony reflects the strength of the unitary correlations and their extent within the population, the numerical size of the population, and the degree of phase concentration for the units of the correlated subset. This value remains substantial, or at least significant, for wide ranges of values of these parameters. In contrast, the unit-to-aggregate coherence function for the remaining uncorrelated units has very low values at all frequencies, and tends to zero in the case of a large population. On the basis of these properties, an approach is presented for analysis of synchrony (correlations) in a neural population, which is simple and efficient, particularly when the population is large in numerical size. This approach utilizes unit-to-aggregate coherence computations for a sample of recorded unitary activities as a means for detecting population synchrony and estimating the extent of synchrony. In addition, this analysis can provide useful information on other characteristics of synchrony, such as the strengths of the unitary correlations. The use of the approach is demonstrated with an example from a study of fast rhythms in inspiratory activities, and other applications are also briefly described. The main advantage of unit-to-aggregate coherence analysis is that by using readily recorded activities, it efficiently identifies correlated units in a population and provides information on characteristics of synchrony, at every frequency within the range of interest.},

abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be delivered over a nerve trunk or muscle belly and can generate contractions by activating motor (peripheral pathway) and sensory (central pathway) axons. In the present experiments, we compared the peripheral and central contributions to plantar flexion contractions evoked by stimulation over the tibial nerve vs. the triceps surae muscles. Generating contractions through central pathways follows Henneman's size principle, whereby low-threshold motor units are activated first, and this may have advantages for rehabilitation. Statistical analyses were performed on data from trials in which NMES was delivered to evoke 10-30{\%} maximum voluntary torque 2-3 s into the stimulation (Time(1)). Two patterns of stimulation were delivered: 1) 20 Hz for 8 s; and 2) 20-100-20 Hz for 3-2-3 s. Torque and soleus electromyography were quantified at the beginning (Time(1)) and end (Time(2); 6-7 s into the stimulation) of each stimulation train. H reflexes (central pathway) and M waves (peripheral pathway) were quantified. Motor unit activity that was not time-locked to each stimulation pulse as an M wave or H reflex ("asynchronous" activity) was also quantified as a second measure of central recruitment. Torque was not different for stimulation over the nerve or the muscle. In contrast, M waves were approximately five to six times smaller, and H reflexes were approximately two to three times larger during NMES over the nerve vs. the muscle. Asynchronous activity increased by 50{\%} over time, regardless of the stimulation location or pattern, and was largest during NMES over the muscle belly. Compared with NMES over the triceps surae muscles, NMES over the tibial nerve produced contractions with a relatively greater central contribution, and this may help reduce muscle atrophy and fatigue when NMES is used for rehabilitation.},

abstract = {The numbers of functioning motor units can be estimated in proximal and distal muscles of human limbs by an electrophysiological technique in which the mean sizes of the motor unit potentials are compared with the maximum M-waves of the same muscles. Although manual methods of estimation have been used successfully in the past, the introduction of automated techniques has brought considerable advantages, including greater objectivity and reduced contamination of the results by "alternation." In healthy subjects, the intrinsic muscles of the hand have approximately 100 motor units each, and the biceps brachii muscle has only slightly more. With advancing age, there is a loss of motor units, which appears to be more pronounced in distal muscles. The motor unit estimating methodology has been found to be of value in the diagnosis and assessment of patients suspected of having muscle denervation. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the mean rate of motor unit loss is swift, whereas in late-onset cases of spinal muscular atrophy, the reduction in the motor unit population does not appear to progress. In only the most rapidly deteriorating cases of post-polio syndrome is it possible to demonstrate further loss of motor units. In all of these denervating disorders, and in peripheral neuropathies, the importance of collateral reinnervation as a compensatory mechanism is emphasized.},

abstract = {The review proposes a comparison between recurrent inhibition in motor systems of vertebrates and the leech nervous system, where a detailed cellular and functional analysis has been accomplished. A comparative study shows that recurrent inhibition is a conserved property in motor systems of phylogenetically distant species. Recurrent inhibition has been extensively characterized in the spinal cord of mammals, where Renshaw cells receive excitatory synaptic inputs from motoneurons (MNs) and, in turn, exert an inhibitory effect on the MNs. In the leech, a recurrent inhibitory circuit has been described, centered around a pair of nonspiking (NS) neurons. NS are linked to every excitatory MN through rectifying electrical junctions. And, in addition, the MNs are linked to the NS neurons through hyperpolarizing chemical synapses. Functional analysis of this leech circuit showed that heteronymous MNs in the leech are electrically coupled and this coupling is modulated by the membrane potential of NS neurons. Like Renshaw cells, the membrane potential of NS neurons oscillates in phase with rhythmic motor patterns. Functional analysis performed in the leech shows that NS influences the activity of MNs in the course of crawling suggesting that the recurrent inhibitory circuit modulates the motor performance. ?? 2014.},

Presynaptic inhibition was assessed using D1 inhibition of the soleus and the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) H reflexes elicited by electrical stimuli applied to the nerve supplying antagonistic muscles, and postactivation depression was explored by varying the time interval between two consecutive H reflexes. In normal subjects no right-left asymmetry was found in the amount of presynaptic Ia inhibition, homosynaptic depression or the H-max/M-max ratio. In the hemiplegic side of patients with MCA area lesions, the H-max/M-max ratio was significantly increased in the soleus but not in the FCR, Presynaptic inhibition of Ia terminals, which was significantly reduced at the cervical level on the hemiplegic side land also, hut to a lesser extent, on the unaffected side), was unchanged at the lumbar level. Homosynaptic depression was similarly reduced at the cervical and lumbar levels on the hemiplegic side but not modified on the unaffected side, It is argued that the decrease in presynaptic inhibition of Ia terminals is more a correlate of spasticity than a mechanism underlying it. The decrease in postactivation depression, which very probably contributes to the exaggeration of the stretch reflex characterizing spasticity, might be a consequence of the changes in the pattern of activation of Ia afferents and MNs following the motor impairment.},

In telecommunications, frequency modulation (FM) is less susceptible to interference than amplitude modulation (AM) and is therefore preferred for high-fidelity transmissions. Here we hypothesized that LFP rhythms detected from deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease could represent movement-related activity not only in AM but also in FM. By combining adaptive autoregressive identification with spectral power decomposition, we were able to show that FM of low-beta (13-20 Hz) and high-beta (20-35 Hz) rhythms significantly contributes to the involvement of the human STN in movement preparation, execution and recovery, and that the FM patterns are regulated by the dopamine levels in the system. Movement-related FM of beta oscillatory activity in the human subthalamic nucleus therefore provides a novel informational domain for rhythm-based pathophysiological models of cortico-basal ganglia processing.},

abstract = {The crosstalk phenomenon consists in recording the volume-conducted electromyographic activity of muscles other than that under study. This interference may impair the correct interpretation of the results in a variety of experiments. A new protocol is presented here for crosstalk assessment between two muscles based on changes in their electrical activity following a reflex discharge in one of the muscles in response to nerve stimulation. A reflex compound muscle action potential (H-reflex) was used to induce a silent period in the muscle that causes the crosstalk, called here the remote muscle. The rationale is that if the activity recorded in the target muscle is influenced by a distant source (the remote muscle) a silent period observed in the electromyogram (EMG) of the remote muscle would coincide with a decrease in the EMG activity of the target muscle. The new crosstalk index is evaluated based on the root mean square (RMS) values of the EMGs obtained in two distinct periods (background EMG and silent period) of both the remote and the target muscles. In the present work the application focused on the estimation of the degree of crosstalk from the soleus muscle to the tibialis anterior muscle during quiet stance. However, the technique may be extended to other pairs of muscles provided a silent period may be evoked in one of them. (C) 2009 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abnormal low-gamma activity, hypothesized to reflect impaired synchronization, has been evidenced in several brain disorders. Thus, understanding the relations between gamma oscillations, neuronal synchrony and behavior is a major research challenge. We used a brain-machine interface (BMI) to train monkeys to specifically increase low-gamma power in selected sites of motor cortex to move a cursor and obtain a reward. The monkeys learned to robustly generate oscillatory gamma waves, which were accompanied by a dramatic increase of spiking synchrony of highly precise spatiotemporal patterns. The findings link volitional control of LFP oscillations, neuronal synchrony, and the behavioral outcome. Subjects@ ability to directly modulate specific patterns of neuronal synchrony provides a powerful approach for understanding neuronal processing in relation to behavior and for the use of BMIs in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {We addressed a hypothesis that changes in indices of finger interaction during maximal force production (MVC) tasks are accompanied by changed coordination of fingers in multi-finger accurate force production tasks. To modify relative involvement of extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles, the subjects produced force by pressing either at their distal phalanges or at their proximal phalanges. As in earlier studies, in MVC trials, the elderly subjects showed a greater force decline when pressing at the proximal phalanges as compared to pressing at the distal phalanges. Two methods were applied to analyze finger coordination during the task of four-finger force production from zero to 30{\{}{\%}{\}} of MVC over 5 s, at the level of finger forces (performance variables) and at the level of modes (control variables). Our previous observations of higher indices of variability during the ramp task in elderly subjects have been generalized to both sites of force application. An index of finger force covariation (the difference between the variance of the total force and the sum of the variances of individual finger forces) revealed small age related differences, which did not depend on the site of the force application. In contrast, analysis of covariation of force modes within the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis showed much better stabilization of the time profile of the total force by young subjects. The UCM hypothesis was also used to test stabilization of the pronation/supination moment during the ramp task. Young subjects showed better moment stabilization than elderly. Age related differences in both force- and moment-stabilization effects were particularly strong during force application at the proximal phalanges. We conclude that the drop in MVC is accompanied in elderly subjects with worse coordination of control signals to fingers in multi-finger tasks. The UCM analysis was more powerful as compared to analysis of force variance profiles in revealing significant differences between the groups. This general result underscores the importance of efforts to analyze motor coordination using control rather than performance variables.},

abstract = {The history of motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is given, together with brief descriptions of the various methods presently available, A small muscle of the hand contains about 100 motor units and greater numbers are found in larger muscles; beyond 60 years the numbers begin to decline. In ALS approximately half the motor units cease to function within 6 months of the involvement of the motoneuron pool, while in adult spinal muscular atrophy further loss may not occur over several years. The reduction in MUNE values in myotonic dystrophy remains an enigma, but even more curious are the losses and subsequent recoveries occasionally observed in hyperthyroidism and chronic renal failure; possibly, nontransmitting (''silent'') synapses are involved. MUNE may also be used to study CNS problems such as hemiplegia and congenital brachial palsy. The availability of more powerful computers for EMG should lead to advances in MUNE.

@article{Heckman1991,
abstract = {1. A pool of 100 simulated motor units was constructed in which the steady-state neural and mechanical properties of the units were very closely matched to the available experimental data for the cat medial gastrocnemius motoneuron pool and muscle. The resulting neural network generated quantitative predictions of whole system input-output functions based on the single unit data. The results of the simulations were compared with experimental data on normal motor system behavior in humans and animals. 2. We considered only steady-state, isometric conditions. All motoneurons received equal proportions of the synaptic input, and no feedback loops were operative. Thus the intrinsic properties of the motor unit population alone determined the form of the system input-output function. Expressing the synaptic input in terms of effective synaptic current allowed the simulated motoneuron input-output functions to be specified by well-known firing rate-injected current relations. The motor unit forces were determined from standard motor unit force-frequency relations, and the system output at any input level was assumed to be the linear sum of the forces of the active motor units. 3. The steady-state input-output function of the simulated motoneuron pool had a roughly sigmoidal shape that was quite different from those derived from previous recruitment models, which did not incorporate frequency modulation. Frequency modulation in combination with the skewed distribution of thresholds (low values much more frequent than high) restricted upward curvature to low input levels, whereas frequency modulation alone was responsible for the final gradual approach to the maximum force output. 4. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the importance of several assumptions that were required to deal with gaps and uncertainties in the available experimental data. The shape of the input-output function was not critically dependent on any of these assumptions, including those specifying linear summation of inputs and outputs. 5. A key assumption of the model was that systematic variance in motor unit properties was much more important than random variance for determining the input-output function. Addition of random variance via Monte Carlo techniques showed that this assumption was correct. These results suggest that the output of a motoneuron pool should be quite tolerant of random variance in the distribution of synaptic inputs and yet substantially altered by any systematic differences, such as unequal distribution of inputs among different motor unit types. 6. The use of Monte Carlo techniques to reduce the level of covariance between the motor unit thresholds and forces to that reported in the experimental data resulted in simulated recruitment orders that were much more variable than those reported for hindlimb muscles of decerebrate cats. It is suggested that the distribution of effective synaptic current from homonymous Ia afferents within the motoneuron pool may significantly enhance the orderliness of motor unit recruitment. 7. Uniform synaptic input to the model motoneuron pool resulted in considerable "over-stimulation" of low-threshold motoneurons, that is, firing rates in excess of the fusion frequency of their muscle units. However, we found that marked frequency limiting of the low-threshold units could be obtained by introducing a modest degree of nonlinear summation to the processing of synaptic input. Moreover, this frequency limiting was accomplished with only subtle changes in the overall input-output function. 8. The system gain was linearly related to total muscle force only at low force levels, as expected from the sigmoidal-shaped input-output function. This result implies that "automatic gain compensation" of reflexes can only be attributed to the intrinsic properties of motor units if it too is restricted to low force levels.},

@article{Matthews1994,
abstract = {1. The stretch reflexes of the human abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and biceps brachii muscles were compared using small-amplitude sinusoidal stretching at 10-50 Hz and recording the surface EMG, The stimulus was applied either to the relevant proximal phalanx or to the biceps tendon while the muscle studied was contracting; the same amplitude was used for all frequencies (range 0.5-2 mm for ADM, 0.1-1 mm for biceps). 2. As the frequency increased, the response of ADM decreased while that of biceps increased. Neither muscle showed a minimum at 20-25 Hz, as previously found for wrist muscles and attributed to an interaction between short- and long-latency components of the reflex. 3. For both muscles, the phase of the response lagged behind the stimulus by an amount which increased approximately linearly with frequency, without the gross inflexion found for wrist muscles. Such linearity would be found for a system dominated by a fixed time delay; its value sets the slope. The slope for biceps was half that for ADM. The values of reflex delay calculated from the slope of the phase plots agreed reasonably with the absolute latencies of the responses evoked by tap or ramp stimulation. Part of the difference between the muscles was due to differences in peripheral conduction time, since ADM lies more distally. Most of it, however, was due to different reflexes being involved, with biceps being predominantly controlled by short-latency pathways and BDM by long-latency pathways. 4. For both muscles, the phase lag at any given frequency was less than that expected from the reflex latency, determined from the slope of the phase plot. Thus, sensory transduction and central transmission had produced a phase advance in the reflex. The 'neural phase advance' of biceps was appreciably larger than that of ADM, and more than would be expected from the behaviour of its spindle afferents. The excess is suggested to be due to the action of Renshaw inhibition, which ADM may lack. 5. The results were substantiated by recording from single motor units in biceps. Stretching at the present amplitudes had rather little effect on the overall rhythmic behaviour, as shown by interspike interval histograms. However, cycle histograms showed that the discharge was modulated reasonably sinusoidally by the stretching, whatever its frequency (i.e. the probability of the occurrence of a spike varied over the cycle). Cyclic changes were also found in autocorrelograms and amplitude spectra of the spike trains. 6. The surface EMG recordings were shown to smooth and slightly delay the expression of the reflex in relation to the underlying unitary responses, while preserving its essentials. The extra delay introduced by surface recording arose from the finite duration of the unitary spikes and could be corrected for by subtracting half the mean spike duration. 7. Thus, the present experiments support the view that the complexities previously seen in the frequency response of wrist muscles arise from interaction between short- and long-latency components of the reflex; they cannot be due to the inherent rhythmicity of the firing of individual motoneurones, since biceps and ADM fail to show them. The frequency response, over the range 10-50 Hz, emerges as an effective tool for analysis of the stretch reflex of a given muscle. It demonstrates the relative importance of short- and long-latency pathways in the genesis of the reflex, indicates the central delays involved, and assesses the ability of the neural circuitry involved to operate at different frequencies.},

abstract = {A mathematical model is developed for simulation of action potential propagation through a single branch point of a myelinated nerve fiber with a parent branch bifurcating into two identical daughter branches. This model is based on a previously published multi-layer compartmental model for single unbranched myelinated nerve fibers. Essential modifications were made to couple both daughter branches to the parent branch. There are two major features in this model. First, the model could incorporate detailed geometrical parameters for the myelin sheath and the axon, accomplished by dividing both structures into many segments. Second, each segment has two layers, the myelin sheath and the axonal membrane, allowing voltages of intra-axonal space and periaxonal space to be calculated separately. In this model, K ion concentration in the periaxonal space is dynamically linked to the activity of axonal fast K channels underneath the myelin in the paranodal region. Our model demonstrates that the branch point acts like a low-pass filter, blocking high-frequency transmission from the parent to the daughter branches. Theoretical analysis showed that the cutoff frequency for transmission through the branch point is determined by temperature, local K ion accumulation, width of the periaxonal space, and internodal lengths at the vicinity of the branch point. Our result is consistent with empirical findings of irregular spacing of nodes of Ranvier at axon abors, suggesting that branch points of myelinated axons play important roles in signal integration in an axonal tree.},

abstract = {We propose a method for the time-resolved joint analysis of two related aspects of single neuron variability, the spiking irregularity measured by the squared coefficient of variation (CV(2)) of the ISIs and the trial-by-trial variability of the spike count measured by the Fano factor (FF). We provide a calibration of both estimators using the theory of renewal processes, and verify it for spike trains recorded in vitro. Both estimators exhibit a considerable bias for short observations that count less than about 5-10 spikes on average. The practical difficulty of measuring the CV(2) in rate modulated data can be overcome by a simple procedure of spike train demodulation which was tested in numerical simulations and in real spike trains. We propose to test neuronal spike trains for deviations from the null-hypothesis FF=CV(2). We show that cortical pyramidal neurons, recorded under controlled stationary input conditions in vitro, comply with this assumption. Performing a time-resolved joint analysis of CV(2) and FF of a single unit recording from the motor cortex of a behaving monkey we demonstrate how the dynamic change of their quantitative relation can be interpreted with respect to neuron intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence cortical variability in vivo. Finally, we discuss the effect of several additional factors such as serial interval correlation and refractory period on the empiric relation of FF and CV(2).},

abstract = {We present a neurorobotic framework to investigate tactile information processing at the early stages of the somatosensory pathway. We focus on spatiotemporal coding of first and second order responses to Braille stimulation, which offers a suitable protocol to investigate the neural bases of fine touch discrimination. First, we model Slow Adaptive type I fingertip mechanoreceptor responses to Braille characters sensed both statically and dynamically. We employ a network of spiking neurones to transduce analogue skin deformations into primary spike trains. Then, we model second order neurones in the cuneate nucleus (CN) of the brainstem to study how mechanoreceptor responses are possibly processed prior to their transmission to downstream central areas. In the model, the connectivity layout of mechanoreceptor-to-cuneate projections produces a sparse CN code. To characterise the reliability of neurotransmission we employ an information theoretical measure accounting for the metrical properties of spiking signals. Our results show that perfect discrimination of primary and secondary responses to a set of 26 Braille characters is achieved within 100 and 500 ms of stimulus onset, in static and dynamic conditions, respectively. Furthermore, clusters of responses to different stimuli are better separable after the CN processing. This finding holds for both statically and dynamically delivered stimuli. In the presented system, when sliding the artificial fingertip over a Braille line, a speed of 40-50mm/s is optimal in terms of rapid and reliable character discrimination. This result is coherent with psychophysical observations reporting average reading speeds of 30-40±5 mm/s adopted by expert Braille readers.},

As a single parameter, area pave rather good discrimination, while amplitude, duration and area/amplitude did not give good discrimination. Only 15-30{\%} of MUPs from neurogenic muscles were judged to be abnormal by duration alone. The combination of amplitude and the area/amplitude ratio (area/amp; MW thickness) improved the discrimination considerably and around 70{\%} of MUPs in the neurogenic group were judged to be abnormal. A simple assigned discriminant function, 2Xlog 10(amp)+ area/amp, gave similar good results for both biceps brachii and tibialis anterior muscles, and this value was named as ''size index.'' The experiment of manual scanning of an MUP revealed that area/amp increases, that is, the MUP becomes thicker, as the amplitude decreases for each MUP with increasing recording distance, while the size index remains almost constant for each MUP irrespective of the electrode position. The new parameter, size index, is promising since it is more stable and gives better discrimination results than duration.},

Our results are compatible with the essential role of gap junctions in olfactory glomeruli and retinal ganglionar cell output. Synchronization and global oscillations also emerge from the network dynamics.

We then tested the resulting excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and its inhibition by inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) under the above conditions and found that the introduction of a dendritic active conductance had prominent effects on the synaptic potentials. Our simulations lead to the following key observations: (1) the presence of the voltage-dependent channels in the dendrites is vital for obtaining EPSPpeak enhancement. (2) The EPSPpeak of the ED and ER models are similar, while the standard deviation (SD) of the EPSPpeak ED model compared to the ER model is larger. (3) Voltage dependent conductance, proximal to the soma, enhanced EPSPpeak inhibition significantly more than distally located active channels. (4) The EPSPpeak inhibition in the passive model is less efficient than in the ED model, but more than in the ER model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The interaction of different orientation senses contributing to posture control is not well understood. We therefore performed experiments in which we measured the postural responses of normal subjects and vestibular loss patients during perturbation of their stance. Subjects stood on a motion platform with their eyes closed and auditory cues masked. The perturbing stimuli consisted of either platform tilts or external torque produced by force-controlled pull of the subjects' body on a stationary platform. Furthermore, we presented trials in which these two stimuli were applied when the platform was body-sway referenced (i.e., coupled 1:1 to body position, by which ankle joint proprioceptive feedback is essentially removed). We analyzed subjects' postural responses, i.e., the excursions of their center of mass (COM) and center of pressure (COP), using a systems analysis approach. We found gain and phase of the responses to vary as a function of stimulus frequency and in relation to the absence versus presence of vestibular and proprioceptive cues. In addition, gain depended on stimulus amplitude, reflecting a non-linearity in the control. The experimental results were compared to simulation results obtained from an 'inverted pendulum' model of posture control. In the model, sensor fusion mechanisms yield internal estimates of the external stimuli, i.e., of the external torque (pull), the platform tilt and gravity. These estimates are derived from three sensor systems: ankle proprioceptors, vestibular sensors and plantar pressure sensors (somatosensory graviceptors). They are fed as global set point signals into a local control loop of the ankle joints, which is based on proprioceptive negative feedback. This local loop stabilizes the body-on-foot support, while the set point signals upgrade the loop into a body-in-space control. Amplitude non-linearity was implemented in the model in the form of central threshold mechanisms. In model simulations that combined sensor fusion and thresholds, an automatic context-specific sensory re-weighting across stimulus conditions occurred. Model parameters were identified using an optimization procedure. Results suggested that in the sway-referenced condition normal subjects altered their postural strategy by strongly weighting feedback from plantar somatosensory force sensors. Taking this strategy change into account, the model's simulation results well paralleled all experimental results across all conditions tested.},

Technical considerations for recording the EMG signal with maximal fidelity are reviewed, and a compendium of all known factors that affect the information contained in the EMG signal is presented. Questions are posed to guide the practitioner in the proper use of surface electromyography. Sixteen recommendations are made regarding the proper detection, analysis, and interpretation of the EMG signal and measured force. Sixteen outstanding problems that present the greatest challenges to the advancement of surface electromyography are put forward for consideration.

abstract = {Surface electromyograms (EMGs) recorded with a couple of electrodes are meant to comprise representative information of the whole muscle activation. Nonetheless, regional variations in neuromuscular activity seem to occur in numerous conditions, from standing to passive muscle stretching. In this study, we show how local activation of skeletal muscles can be automatically tracked from EMGs acquired with a bi-dimensional grid of surface electrodes (a grid of 8 rows and 15 columns was used). Grayscale images were created from simulated and experimental EMGs, filtered and segmented into clusters of activity with the watershed algorithm. The number of electrodes on each cluster and the mean level of neuromuscular activity were used to assess the accuracy of the segmentation of simulated signals. Regardless of the noise level, thickness of fat tissue and acquisition configuration (monopolar or single differential), the segmentation accuracy was above 60{\{}{\%}{\}}. Accuracy values peaked close to 95{\{}{\%}{\}} when pixels with intensity below similar to 70{\{}{\%}{\}} of maximal EMG amplitude in each segmented cluster were excluded. When simulating opposite variations in the activity of two adjacent muscles, watershed segmentation produced clusters of activity consistently centered on each simulated portion of active muscle and with mean amplitude close to the simulated value. Finally, the segmentation algorithm was used to track spatial variations in the activity, within and between medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, during isometric plantar flexion contraction and in quiet standing position. In both cases, the regionalization of neuromuscular activity occurred and was consistently identified with the segmentation method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Despite intense research, few treatments are available for most neurological disorders. Demyelinating diseases are no exception. This is perhaps not surprising considering the multifactorial nature of these diseases, which involve complex interactions between immune system cells, glia and neurons. In the case of multiple sclerosis, for example, there is no unanimity among researchers about the cause or even which system or cell type could be ground zero. This situation precludes the development and strategic application of mechanism-based therapies. We will discuss how computational modeling applied to questions at different biological levels can help link together disparate observations and decipher complex mechanisms whose solutions are not amenable to simple reductionism. By making testable predictions and revealing critical gaps in existing knowledge, such models can help direct research and will provide a rigorous framework in which to integrate new data as they are collected. Nowadays, there is no shortage of data; the challenge is to make sense of it all. In that respect, computational modeling is 
an invaluable tool that could, ultimately, transform how we understand, diagnose, and treat demyelinating diseases.},

abstract = {The investigation of multiple nerve membrane properties by mathematical models has become a new tool to study peripheral neuropathies. In demyelinating neuropathies, the membrane properties such as potentials (intracellular, extracellular, electrotonic) and indices of axonal excitability (strength-duration time constants, rheobases and recovery cycles) can now be measured at the peripheral nerves. This study provides numerical simulations of the membrane properties of human motor nerve fibre in cases of internodal, paranodal and simultaneously of paranodal internodal demyelinations, each of them mild systematic or severe focal. The computations use our previous multi-layered model of the fibre. The results show that the abnormally greater increase of the hyperpolarizing electrotonus, shorter strength-duration time constants and greater axonal superexcitability in the recovery cycles are the characteristic features of the mildly systematically demyelinated cases. The small decrease of the polarizing electrotonic responses in the demyelinated zone in turn leads to a compensatory small increase of these responses outside the demyelinated zone of all severely focally demyelinated cases. The paper summarizes the insights gained from these modeling studies on the membrane property abnormalities underlying the variation in clinical symptoms of demyelination in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barr{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} syndrome and multifocal motor neuropathy. The model used provides an objective study of the mechanisms of these diseases which up till now have not been sufficiently well understood, because quite different assumptions have been given in the literature for the interpretation of the membrane property abnormalities obtained in hereditary, chronic and acquired demyelinating neuropathies.},

abstract = {We have recently demonstrated in simulations and experiments that a proportional and derivative (PD) feedback controller can regulate the active ankle torque during quiet stance and stabilize the body despite a long sensory-motor time delay. The purpose of the present study was to: 1) model the active and passive ankle torque mechanisms and identify their contributions to the total ankle torque during standing and 2) investigate whether a neural-mechanical control scheme that implements the PD controller as the neural controller can successfully generate the total ankle torque as observed in healthy individuals during quiet stance. Fourteen young subjects were asked to stand still on a force platform to acquire data for model optimization and validation. During two trials of 30 s each, the fluctuation of the body angle, the electromyogram of the right soleus muscle, and the ankle torque were recorded. Using these data, the parameters of: 1) the active and passive torque mechanisms (Model I) and 2) the PD controller within the neural-mechanical control scheme (Model II) were optimized to achieve potential matching between the measured and predicted ankle torque. The performance of the two models was finally validated with a new set of data. Our results indicate that not only the passive, but also the active ankle torque mechanism contributes significantly to the total ankle torque and, hence, to body stabilization during quiet stance. In addition, we conclude that the proposed neural-mechanical control scheme successfully mimics the physiological control strategy during quiet stance and that a PD controller is a legitimate model for the strategy that the central nervous system applies to regulate the active ankle torque in spite of a long sensory-motor time delay.},

abstract = {The output of skeletal muscle can be varied by selectively recruiting different motor units. However, our knowledge of muscle function is largely derived from muscle in which all motor units are activated. This discrepancy may limit our understanding of in vivo muscle function. Hence, this study aimed to characterize the mechanical properties of muscle with different motor unit activation. We determined the isometric properties and isotonic force-velocity relationship of rat plantaris muscles in situ with all of the muscle active, 30{\%} of the muscle containing predominately slower motor units active or 20{\%} of the muscle containing predominately faster motor units active. There was a significant effect of active motor unit type on isometric force rise time (p < 0.001) and the force-velocity relationship (p < 0.001). Surprisingly, force rise time was longer and maximum shortening velocity higher when all motor units were active than when either fast or slow motor units were selectively activated. We propose this is due to the greater relative effects of factors such as series compliance and muscle resistance to shortening during sub-maximal contractions. The findings presented here suggest that recruitment according to the size principle, where slow motor units are activated first and faster ones recruited as demand increases, may not pose a mechanical paradox, as has been previously suggested.},

abstract = {Discharges of single motor units (MUs) in human triceps brachii and deltoid muscle were recorded using needle electromyography during after-contraction and voluntary contraction performed either against a small elastic load or under isometry. The steady-state firing rate of the MUs was lower under after-contraction than during voluntary movement of comparable amplitude and time course (or isometric force level), whereas variability of interspike intervals was similar under the two conditions. In the tibialis anterior muscle (where after-contraction was lacking), a weak voluntary contraction preceded by sustained strong voluntary effort also showed lower firing rate of MUs as compared to similar voluntary movement performed after a rest period. We concluded that sustained contraction gave rise to peripheral potentiation of contractile properties of the muscle, irrespective of whether it was proximal or distal, whereas after-contraction was due to a central tonic drive that differed for proximal and distal muscles.

abstract = {Human motor control is often explained in terms of engineering 'servo' theory. Recently, continuous, optimal control using internal models has emerged as a leading paradigm for voluntary movement. However, these engineering paradigms are designed for high band-width, inflexible, consistent systems whereas human control is low bandwidth and flexible using noisy sensors and actuators. By contrast, engineering intermittent control was designed for bandwidth-limited applications. Our general interest is whether intermittent rather than continuous control is generic to human motor control. Currently, it would be assumed that continuous control is the superior and physiologically natural choice for controlling unstable loads, for example as required for maintaining human balance. Using visuo-manual tracking of an unstable load, we show that control using gentle, intermittent taps is entirely natural and effective. The gentle tapping method resulted in slightly superior position control and velocity minimisation, a reduced feedback time delay, greater robustness to changing actuator gain and equal or greater linearity with respect to the external disturbance. Control was possible with a median contact rate of 0.8±0.3 s(-1). However, when optimising position or velocity regulation, a modal contact rate of 2 s(-1) was observed. This modal rate was consistent with insignificant disturbance-joystick coherence beyond 1-2 Hz in both tapping and continuous contact methods. For this load, these results demonstrate a motor control process of serial ballistic trajectories limited to an optimum rate of 2 s(-1). Consistent with theoretical reasoning, our results suggest that intermittent open loop action is a natural consequence of human physiology.},

All currently available methods incorporate explicit and implicit assumptions about the nature of the unit impulses under study. Preliminary investigations using DCV methods have clarified some issues concerning conduction of impulses in the different fiber subpopulations of normal and diseased human nerves. In the presence of severe nerve disease, DCV analysis is usually either impractical or superfluous; additional studies are needed to define its range of clinical applicability. Extension of this technology to clinical analysis of small myelinated and unmyelinated fiber populations will require improvements in the techniques of nerve stimulation and recording.},

abstract = {Traveling waves of neuronal oscillations have been observed in many cortical regions, including the motor and sensory cortex. Such waves are often modulated in a task-dependent fashion although their precise functional role remains a matter of debate. Here we conjecture that the cortex can utilize the direction and wavelength of traveling waves to encode information. We present a novel neural mechanism by which such information may be decoded by the spatial arrangement of receptors within the dendritic receptor field. In particular, we show how the density distributions of excitatory and inhibitory receptors can combine to act as a spatial filter of wave patterns. The proposed dendritic mechanism ensures that the neuron selectively responds to specific wave patterns, thus constituting a neural basis of pattern decoding. We validate this proposal in the descending motor system, where we model the large receptor fields of the pyramidal tract neurons - the principle outputs of the motor cortex - decoding motor commands encoded in the direction of traveling wave patterns in motor cortex. We use an existing model of field oscillations in motor cortex to investigate how the topology of the pyramidal cell receptor field acts to tune the cells responses to specific oscillatory wave patterns, even when those patterns are highly degraded. The model replicates key findings of the descending motor system during simple motor tasks, including variable interspike intervals and weak corticospinal coherence. By additionally showing how the nature of the wave patterns can be controlled by modulating the topology of local intra-cortical connections, we hence propose a novel integrated neuronal model of encoding and decoding motor commands.},

abstract = {Insight into the magnitude of muscle forces is important in biomechanics research, for example because muscle forces are the main determinants of joint loading. Unfortunately muscle forces cannot be calculated directly and can only be measured using invasive procedures. Therefore, estimates of muscle force based on surface EMG measurements are frequently used. This review discusses the problems associated with surface EMG in muscle force estimation and the solutions that novel methodological developments provide to this problem. First, some basic aspects of muscle activity and EMG are reviewed and related to EMG amplitude estimation. The main methodological issues in EMG amplitude estimation are precision and representativeness. Lack of precision arises directly from the stochastic nature of the EMG signal as the summation of a series of randomly occurring polyphasic motor unit potentials and the resulting random constructive and destructive (phase cancellation) superimpositions. Representativeness is an issue due the structural and functional heterogeneity of muscles. Novel methods, i.e. multi-channel monopolar EMG and high-pass filtering or whitening of conventional bipolar EMG allow substantially less variable estimates of the EMG amplitude and yield better estimates of muscle force by (1) reducing effects of phase cancellation, and (2) adequate representation of the heterogeneous activity of motor units within a muscle. With such methods, highly accurate predictions of force, even of the minute force fluctuations that occur during an isometric and isotonic contraction have been achieved. For dynamic contractions, EMG-based force estimates are confounded by the effects of muscle length and contraction velocity on force producing capacity. These contractions require EMG amplitude estimates to be combined with modeling of muscle contraction dynamics to achieve valid force predictions.},

abstract = {Several signal processing tools have been employed in the experimental study of the postural control system in humans. Among them, the cross-correlation function has been used to analyze the time relationship between signals such as the electromyogram and the horizontal projection of the center of gravity. The common finding is that the electromyogram precedes the biomechanical signal, a result that has been interpreted in different ways, for example, the existence of feedforward control or the preponderance of a velocity feedback. It is shown here, analytically and by simulation, that the cross-correlation function is depedent in a complicated way on system parameters and on noise spectra. Results similar to those found experimentally, e.g., electromyiogram preceding the biomechanical signal may be obtained in a postural control model without any feedforward control and without any velocity feedback. Therefore, correct interpretations of experimentally obtained cross-correlation functions may require additional information about the system. The results extend to other biomedical applications where two signals from a closed loop system are cross-correlated.},

abstract = {This article considers the intersensory interaction mechanisms and biomechanical aspects of human spatially oriented behavior and asks to what extent these are interrelated on earth by gravity and how they might be affected under microgravity. The interactions between vestibular, somatosensory and visual inputs for postural control are obscured by several complications (biomechanics, multi-body dynamics, multimodal feedback control, cognition etc.). However, they can be revealed in psychophysical studies on human self-motion perception. Based on such studies, we present a conceptual model, which we think is valid also for postural control. It accounts for the multi-segmental structure of the body, allowing local control of inter-segmental joints, but uses one global reference system for all segments, which is derived from the intersensory interactions. We hold that, at a sensory level, the system is tied together by linkages between vestibular, visual and somatosensory information which develop through experience of inertial and gravitational reaction forces. On earth these linkages are established even in the absence of active behavior by gravity, allowing the incorporation of one's body and its support into a notion (Gestalt) of ourselves in the environment. Under microgravity, in contrast, the linkages have to be actively established for postural and perceptual stability in the environment (e.g., by grasping a handle on the wall). From this work we recommend that future research under altered gravity conditions should be guided by models that include biomechanics, considerations of intersensory interaction and dynamic control mechanisms. Such an integrative conceptual framework will be helpful for reaching a general understanding of spatially oriented behavior.},

Each MU has parallel fibers uniformly scattered within a cylindrical volume of specified radius embedded in an anisotropic medium. Two action potentials, each modeled as a current tripole, are generated at the neuromuscular junction, propagate in opposite directions and extinguish at the fiber-tendon endings, The neuromuscular junctions and fiber-tendon endings are uniformly scattered within regions of specified width, Muscle fiber conduction velocity and average fiber length to the right and left of the center of the innervation zone are also specified. The signal produced by MU's with different geometries and conduction velocities are superimposed. Monopolar, single differential and double differential signals are computed from electrodes placed in equally spaced locations on the surface of the muscle and are displayed as functions of any of the model's parameters. Spectral and amplitude variable's and conduction velocity are estimated from the surface signals and displayed as functions of any of the model's parameters. The influence of fiber-end effects, electrode misalignment, tissue anisotropy, MU's location and geometry are discussed.

abstract = {In Parkinson's disease (PD) subtle balance abnormalities can already be detected in early-stage patients. One feature of impaired balance control in PD is asymmetry: one leg produces more corrective joint torque than the other. We hypothesize that in mild to moderately affected PD patients, the least impaired leg compensates for the more impaired leg. Twenty PD patients and eleven healthy matched control subjects participated. Clinical asymmetry was determined by the difference between the left and right body side scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Balance was perturbed with two independent continuous multisine perturbations in the forward-backward direction. Subsequently, we applied closed-loop system identification, which determined the spectral estimate of the stabilizing mechanisms, for each leg. Balance control behavior was similar in PD patients and control subjects at the ankle, but at the hip stiffness was increased. Control subjects exhibited symmetric balance control, but in PD patients the balance contribution of the leg of the clinically least affected body side was higher whereas the leg of the clinically most affected body side contributed less. The ratio between the legs helped to preserve a normal motor output at the ankle. Our results suggest that PD patients compensate for balance control asymmetries by increasing the relative contribution of the leg of their least affected body side. This compensation appears to be successful at the ankle but is accompanied by an increased stiffness at the hip. We discuss the possible implications of these findings for postural stability and fall risk in PD patients.},

abstract = {Different measures of directional influence have been employed to infer effective connectivity in the brain. When the connectivity between two regions is such that one of them (the sender) strongly influences the other (the receiver), a positive phase lag is often expected. The assumption is that the time difference implicit in the relative phase reflects the transmission time of neuronal activity. However, Brovelli et al. (2004) observed that, in monkeys engaged in processing a cognitive task, a dominant directional influence from one area of sensorimotor cortex to another may be accompanied by either a negative or a positive time delay. Here we present a model of two brain regions, coupled with a well-defined directional influence, that displays similar features to those observed in the experimental data. This model is inspired by the theoretical framework of Anticipated Synchronization developed in the field of dynamical systems. Anticipated Synchronization is a form of synchronization that occurs when a unidirectional influence is transmitted from a sender to a receiver, but the receiver leads the sender in time. This counterintuitive synchronization regime can be a stable solution of two dynamical systems coupled in a master-slave (sender-receiver) configuration when the slave receives a negative delayed self-feedback. Despite efforts to understand the dynamics of Anticipated Synchronization, experimental evidence for it in the brain has been lacking. By reproducing experimental delay times and coherence spectra, our results provide a theoretical basis for the underlying mechanisms of the observed dynamics, and suggest that the primate cortex could operate in a regime of Anticipated Synchronization as part of normal neurocognitive function.},

abstract = {In humans, one of the most common tasks in everyday life is walking, and sensory afferent feedback from peripheral receptors, particularly the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs (GTO), makes an important contribution to the motor control of this task. One factor that can complicate the ability of these receptors to act as length, velocity and force transducers is the complex pattern of interaction between muscle and tendinous tissues, as tendon length is often considerably greater than muscle fibre length in the human lower limb. In essence, changes in muscle-tendon mechanics can influence the firing behaviour of afferent receptors, which may in turn affect the motor control. In this review we first summarise research that has incorporated the use of ultrasound-based techniques to study muscle-tendon interaction, predominantly during walking. We then review recent research that has combined this method with an examination of muscle activation to give a broader insight to neuromuscular interaction during walking. Despite the advances in understanding that these techniques have brought, there is clearly still a need for more direct methods to study both neural and mechanical parameters during human walking in order to unravel the vast complexity of this seemingly simple task.},

abstract = {Optimal levels of noise stimulation have been shown to enhance the detection and transmission of neural signals thereby improving the performance of sensory and motor systems. The first series of experiments in the present study aimed to investigate whether subsensory electrical noise stimulation applied over the triceps surae (TS) in seated subjects decreases torque variability during a force-matching task of isometric plantar flexion and whether the same electrical noise stimulation decreases postural sway during quiet stance. Correlation tests were applied to investigate whether the noise-induced postural sway decrease is linearly predicted by the noise-induced torque variability decrease. A second series of experiments was conducted to investigate whether there are differences in torque variability between conditions in which the subsensory electrical noise is applied only to the TS, only to the tibialis anterior (TA) and to both TS and TA, during the force-matching task with seated subjects. Noise stimulation applied over the TS muscles caused a significant reduction in force variability during the maintained isometric force paradigm and also decreased postural oscillations during quiet stance. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the reduction in force fluctuation and the decrease in postural sway with the electrical noise stimulation. This last result indicates that changes in plantar flexion force variability in response to a given subsensory random stimulation of the TS may provide an estimate of the variations in postural sway caused by the same subsensory stimulation of the TS. We suggest that the decreases in force variability and postural sway found here are due to stochastic resonance that causes an improved transmission of proprioceptive information. In the second series of experiments, the reduction in force variability found when noise was applied to the TA muscle alone did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that TS proprioception gives a better feedback to reduce force fluctuation in isometric plantar flexion conditions.},

abstract = {The impact of neuromodulators on active dendritic conductances was investigated by the use of intracellular recording techniques in spinal motoneurons in the adult cat. The well known lack of voltage control of dendritic regions during voltage clamp applied at the soma was used to estimate dendritic amplification of a steady monosynaptic input generated by muscle spindle Ia afferents. In preparations deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital, Ia current either decreased with depolarization or underwent a modest increase at membrane potentials above -40 mV. In unanesthetized decerebrate preparations (which have tonic activity in axons originating in the brainstem and releasing serotonin or norepinephrine), active dendritic currents caused strong amplification of Ia input. In the range of -50 to -40 mV, peak Ia current was over four times as large as that in the pentobarbital-anesthetized preparations. Exogenous administration of a noradrenergic agonist in addition to the tonic activity further enhanced amplification (sixfold increase). Amplification was not seen in preparations with spinal transections. Overall, the dendritic amplification with moderate or strong neuromodulatory drive was estimated to be large enough to allow the motoneurons innervating slow muscle fibers to be driven to their maximum force levels by remarkably small synaptic inputs. In these cells, the main role of synaptic input may be to control the activation of a highly excitable dendritic tree. The neuromodulatory control of synaptic amplification provides motor commands with the potential to adjust the level of amplification to suit the demands of different motor tasks.},

abstract = {Maintenance of human upright stance requires the acquisition and integration of sensory inputs. Conventional measures of sway have had success in identifying age- and some disease-related changes, but remain unable to address the complexities and dynamics associated with postural control. We investigated the effects of vision, surface compliance, age, and gender on the spectral content of center of pressure (COP) time series. Sixteen healthy young (age 18-24) and older participants (age 55-65) performed trials of quiet, upright stance under different vision (eyes open vs. closed) and surface (hard vs. compliant) conditions. Spectral analyses were conducted to describe COP mean normalized power in discretized bands. Effects of the two sensory modalities and age were distinct in the antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions, and a reorganization of spectral content was evident with increasing task difficulty (eyes open vs. closed and hard vs. compliant surface) and among older adults. These results indicate that vision and surface compliance are predominantly associated with responses from musculature associated with antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions of sway, respectively. Finally, distinguishing between the contributions of different afferent systems to the postural control system using the spectral content of sway bi-directionally may help in diagnosing individuals with balance impairments.},

abstract = {In order to determine the mono- or oligosynaptic character of connections between pyramidal axons and individual spinal motor neurons, we constructed peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of the firing probability of voluntarily activated single motor units (SMUs) of various upper and lower limb muscles upon slightly suprathreshold transcranial anodal electrical stimulations of the motor cortex in normal subjects. Weak anodal cortical stimuli are known to activate preferentially fast-conducting pyramidal axons directly, bypassing cell bodies and cortical interneurons. A narrow bin width (0.1 ms) was chosen to measure precisely the duration of the PSTH excitatory peak, which corresponds to the rise time of the underlying compound excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP). A short duration PSTH peak indicates sharp-rising EPSPs, most commonly encountered in the case of monosynaptic connections. In flexor carpi radialis and soleus SMUs, the PSTHs of built-in responses to anodal cortical stimuli were compared with those produced by 1A afferent stimulation able to elicit a Hoffmann reflex, which is known to be largely monosynaptic. In all upper and lower limb muscles, excitable SMUs responded to anodal cortical stimuli with a highly synchronized peak of increased firing probability. In flexor carpi radialis and soleus SMUs, the mean duration of this peak was significantly narrower than that evoked by 1A afferent stimulation, indicating that monosynaptic corticomotor neuronal transmission dominates low-threshold motor units, even in proximal arm and leg muscles. In the various muscles studied, and particularly in forearm SMUs, we did not observe broad PSTH peaks against the activation of non-monosynaptic corticomotor neuronal pathways, even with near-threshold stimuli. In some triceps and forearm flexor SMUs, subthreshold anodal pulses caused significant inhibition of their voluntary firing, with a latency consistent with activation of 1A inhibitory interneurons by the descending volleys. Measurements of the maximal number of counts in the excitatory PSTH peak upon anodal cortical stimuli provide comparisons of the strength of monosynaptic inputs to various muscles which seems to be maximal for hand and finger extensor muscles, and also for deltoid.},

abstract = {The effect of electrode position on the upper trapezius muscle on the myo-electric signal amplitude was investigated with special reference to arm position and estimate of force output. Previously, a depression of the electromyogram (EMG) signal has been reported midway between the seventh cervical vertebrae (C7) and acromion (Veiersted 1991, Eur J Appl Physiol 62:91-98) although this electrode position has been recommended (Zipp 1982, Eur J Appl Physiol 50:41-54). Ten healthy subjects performed maximal shoulder elevations with the arm in vertical, abducted and flexed positions and they performed a dynamic movement test. The myo-electric signal was recorded along the length of the right upper trapezius muscle by a 16-channel bipolar array electrode and was integrated with a 0.2-s time resolution. A region just lateral to the midpoint between C7 and the lateral edge of acromion was found with high and stable amplitudes ({\%} coefficient of variation equalled 5.6). At the midpoint a dip in the amplitude profile appeared which was slightly displaced by arm abduction or flexion probably due to sliding of the skin relative to the muscle. A linear EMG-force relationship was found in the region with high signal amplitudes, whereas the more lateral and the dip region showed highly variable EMG-force relationships. Thus, it was found that when using bipolar surface electrodes with an interelectrode distance of 2 cm a centre position 2 cm lateral to the midpoint between C7 and acromion provided good repeatability and high signal yield.},

abstract = {1. The hypothesis that interneurones in the 4th lumbar segment (L4) are interposed between group I and group II afferents and hind-limb motoneurones has been tested. Action potentials of single interneurones were induced by ionophoretically applied homocysteate and recorded in parallel with post-synaptic potentials in motoneurones; the latter were recorded from motor axons in the ventral root of the first sacral segment as population potentials, using the sucrose gap technique. 2. The action potentials of twenty-four L4 interneurones were found to be followed by either e.p.s.p.s. or i.p.s.p.s in motoneurones. The latencies of the majority of these p.s.p.s were consistent with monosynaptically evoked excitation or inhibition of motoneurones since they exceeded the latencies of antidromic activation of the interneurones from the S1 motor nuclei by only a fraction of a millisecond. 3. The dominant input to both the excitatory and the inhibitory interneurones was from group II muscle afferents, in particular from the quadriceps nerve. The latencies of excitation of the interneurones by these afferents indicated a monosynaptic coupling between them. The same interneurones were co-excited by group I and cutaneous afferents and by descending fibres. 4. We conclude that not only excitation but also inhibition of hind-limb motoneurones from group II afferents may be mediated disynaptically and that interneurones in the 4th lumbar segment contribute to both.},

Responses to surface-tilt perturbations with different amplitudes were interpreted using a feedback control model to determine control parameters and changes in these parameters with stimulus amplitude. Different combinations of internal sensory and/or motor noise sources were added to the model to identify the properties of noise sources that were able to account for the experimental remnant sway characteristics. Various behavioral criteria were investigated to determine if optimization of these criteria could predict the identified model parameters and amplitude-dependent parameter changes. Robust findings were that remnant sway characteristics were best predicted by models that included both sensory and motor noise, the graviceptive noise magnitude was about ten times larger than the proprioceptive noise, and noise sources with signal-dependent properties provided better explanations of remnant sway. Overall results indicate that humans dynamically weight sensory system contributions to stance control and tune their corrective responses to minimize the energetic effects of sensory noise and external stimuli.},

It has since been shown that coastal particles are more likely to be produced from the photooxidation of molecular iodine. Moreover, I contend that open-ocean particle production and cloud enhancement do not result from emissions of organic iodine at atmospheric levels. For iodine particles to affect cloud properties over the remote ocean, an additional source of iodine is necessary as organic precursors cannot be responsible.},

Unfortunately, many studies examined discontinuous populations, preventing regression analysis. The correlation coefficients of available studies vary widely, preventing clear conclusions. We retrospectively examined 3969 clinically normal subjects ranging in age from 20 to 95 years from a total of 22,420 electrodiagnostic studies done between 1986 and 1998. The correlation of NCV with height was stronger than with age. Regression equations using both factors account for 12-27{\%} of the variance. Responses were seen in the majority of patients aged 70 years and older, but the percentage of normals who had no response increased with advancing age. Age was strongly inversely correlated with the amplitudes of both sensory and motor responses, accounting for 7-16{\%} of the variance. Regression equations using both height and age improved this correlation, accounting for 7-22{\%} of the variance. Therefore, both height and age must be taken into consideration when normal values are developed. (C) 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {There are several parameters associated with motoneuron size, among which are the conduction velocity of the axon as well as the size of the excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) induced by stimulation of Ia afferents in the corresponding muscle nerve. In particular, it has been established in animal experiments that small motoneurons with a low conduction velocity exhibit large Ia EPSPs, whereas large motoneurons with a high conduction velocity show small Ia EPSPs. Thus small motoneurons are recruited earlier than large ones. In this study, we investigated whether such a relationship between motoaxon conduction velocity and size of the Ia EPSPs could also be found for human soleus motoneurons. In total, 36 motor units from six healthy volunteers were activated by a slight voluntary contraction and exposed to 200 stimuli of the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa. Stimuli were delivered using a special stimulus protocol ensuring a constant pre-stimulus spike density along with a constant rate of discharge of the investigated unit. From the stimulus-correlated spike train data a measure of Ia-EPSP amplitude was obtained, along with the single-unit H-reflex latency. Additionally, for each unit, the so-called surface macro EMG was recorded, which measures the complete electrical activity attributable to the unit investigated. From the macro EMG, the intramuscular delay from arrival of each action potential at the soleus muscle and the detection of the muscle-fiber action potential picked up by the recording needle electrode were measured. All single-unit H-reflex latencies were corrected for the corresponding intramuscular delays. From the corrected latencies, single-unit conduction velocities were obtained. It was found that there was a highly significant negative correlation between the estimate of the single-unit conduction velocity and the inferred size of the Ia EPSP. Thus, it was found that Ia-EPSP amplitudes in human soleus motoneurons follow the size principle.},

abstract = {This paper examines the physiological mechanisms responsible for differences in the amplitude of force fluctuations between young and old adults. Because muscle force is a consequence of motor unit activity, the potential mechanisms include both motor unit properties and the behavior of motor unit populations. The force fluctuations, however, depend not only on the age of the individual but also on the muscle group performing the task, the type and intensity of the muscle contraction, and the physical activity status of the individual. Computer simulations and experimental findings performed on tasks that involved single agonist and antagonist muscles suggest that differences in force fluctuations are not attributable to motor unit twitch force, motor unit number, or nonuniform activation of the agonist muscle, but that they are influenced by the variability and common modulation of motor unit discharge in both the agonist and antagonist muscles. Because the amplitude of the force fluctuations does not vary linearly with muscle activation, these results suggest that multiple mechanisms contribute to the differences in force fluctuations between young and old adults, although the boundary conditions for each mechanism remain to be determined.

abstract = {In this study, we describe a device for the direct measurement of intrinsic ankle stiffness in quiet standing. It consists of a motorised footplate mounted on a force platform. By generating random sequences of step-like disturbances (1 degrees amplitude, 150 ms duration) and measuring the corresponding displacements of the center of pressure in the antero-posterior direction, we obtained torque-rotation patterns after aligning, averaging, and scaling the postural responses. Such patterns were used for estimating the value of the ankle stiffness, which was normalized as a fraction of the critical value. In order to be confident that the measurements addressed the intrinsic ankle stiffness and were not affected in a significant way by the reflex activation of the muscles in response to the test disturbances, we performed the estimates in different ways: least squares estimates with time windows of different widths and an instantaneous estimate at the time in which the angular acceleration vanishes. The statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference among the different methods of estimate and the inspection of the electromyographic activity in response to the perturbations showed that at least two of the estimates were certainly outside the possible influence of reflex patterns. The intrinsic ankle stiffness was evaluated to be 64+/-8{\{}{\%}{\}} of the critical stiffness for test disturbances of the order of 1 degrees. We argue that this figure identifies the lower bound of the range of values which characterise normal sway in quiet standing, whereas the upper bound is given by the estimates performed with much smaller test disturbances [1] which yield a higher value: 91+/-23{\{}{\%}{\}}. The two estimation paradigms (with very small and very large test disturbances, respectively) are complementary also because they behave in a different way as regards the sensitivity to a bias torque: it is close to zero in the Loram {\{}{\&}{\}} Lakie's paradigm, whereas it is significant in our paradigm. Thus, as the bias grows, it appears that the range of stiffness values is narrowed and is pushed towards the upper bound. There is a clear potential for the clinical application of these methods, in the sense that the identification of the range of stiffness values used by a patient is a measurable index of motor organisation/reorganisation.},

abstract = {The design of control systems for limb prostheses seems likely to benefit from an understanding of how sensorimotor integration is achieved in the intact system. Traditional BMIs guess what movement parameters are encoded by brain activity and then decode them to drive prostheses directly. Modeling the known structure and emergent properties of the biological decoder itself is likely to be more effective in bridging from normal brain activity to functionally useful limb movement. In this study, we have extended a model of spinal circuitry (termed SLR for spinal-like regulator; see Raphael, G., Tsianos, G. A., {\&} Loeb G. E. 2010, Spinal-like regulator facilitates control of a two-degree-of-freedom wrist. The Journal of Neuroscience, 30(28), 9431-9444.) to a planar elbow-shoulder system to investigate how the spinal cord contributes to the control of a musculoskeletal system with redundant and multiarticular musculature and interaction (Coriolis) torques, which are common control problems for multisegment linkages throughout the body. The SLR consists of a realistic set of interneuronal pathways (monosynaptic Ia-excitatory, reciprocal Ia-inhibitory, Renshaw inhibitory, Ib-inhibitory, and propriospinal) that are driven by unmodulated step commands with learned amplitudes. We simulated the response of a planar arm to a brief, oblique impulse at the hand and investigated the role of cocontraction in learning to resist it. Training the SLR without cocontraction led to generally poor performance that was significantly worse than training with cocontraction. Further, removing cocontraction from the converged solutions and retraining the system achieved better performance than the SLR responses without cocontraction. Cocontraction appears to reshape the solution space, virtually eliminating the probability of entrapment in poor local minima. The local minima that are entered during learning with cocontraction are favorable starting points for learning to perform the task when cocontraction is abruptly removed. Given the control system's ability to learn effectively and rapidly, we hypothesize that it will generalize more readily to the wider range of tasks that subjects must learn to perform, as opposed to BMIs mapped to outputs of the musculoskeletal system.},

abstract = {Tetanic neuromuscular stimulation evokes contractions by depolarizing motor axons beneath the stimulating electrodes. However, we have shown that extra torque can develop due to the discharge of spinal neurons recruited by the evoked sensory volley. The present experiments investigated whether extra torque in the ankle plantar- and dorsiflexors was associated with enhanced H-reflexes. The tibial and common peroneal nerves were stimulated using 7-s trains (20 Hz for 2 s, 100 Hz for 2 s, 20 Hz for 3 s). Extra torque was defined as significantly more torque during 20-Hz stimulation after the 100-Hz burst (time 2) than before it (time 1). In 9 of 11 subjects, extra plantar-flexion torque developed during stimulation just above motor threshold. In these nine subjects, torque increased from 8 to 13{\%} MVC (time 1 to time 2), the soleus H-reflex increased from 13 to 19{\%} M-max and the M-wave of similar to 2{\%} M-max did not change significantly. To evoke extra dorsiflexion torque, greater stimulation intensities were required. In 6 of 13 subjects, extra torque developed at intensities that evoked an M-wave of 5 similar to 20{\%} M-max at time(1). In these six subjects, torque doubled from 2 to 4{\%} MVC (time(1) to time(2)), whereas tibialis anterior (TA) H-reflexes and M-waves did not change significantly (H-reflex from 0.8 to 2{\%} M-max; M-wave from 12 to 14{\%} M-max). In 7 of 13 subjects, extra torque developed at higher stimulation intensities (35-65{\%} M-max). In these seven subjects, torque increased from 13 to 20{\%} MVC, whereas TA H-reflexes and M-waves were not significantly different (H-reflex from 0.7 to 1{\%} M-max; M-wave from 49 to 54{\%} M-max). Thus enhanced H-reflexes contributed to extra plantar-flexion, however, other factors generated extra dorsiflexion.},

abstract = {Understanding the brain requires a broad range of approaches and methods from the domains of biology, psychology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The fundamental challenge is to decipher the "neural choreography" associated with complex behaviors and functions, including thoughts, memories, actions, and emotions. This demands the acquisition and integration of vast amounts of data of many types, at multiple scales in time and in space. Here we discuss the need for neuroinformatics approaches to accelerate progress, using several illustrative examples. The nascent field of "connectomics" aims to comprehensively describe neuronal connectivity at either a macroscopic level (in long-distance pathways for the entire brain) or a microscopic level (among axons, dendrites, and synapses in a small brain region). The Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) encompasses all of neuroscience and facilitates the integration of existing knowledge and databases of many types. These examples illustrate the opportunities and challenges of data mining across multiple tiers of neuroscience information and underscore the need for cultural and infrastructure changes if neuroinformatics is to fulfill its potential to advance our understanding of the brain.},

abstract = {Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare inflammatory neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive, asymmetric distal limb weakness without sensory loss. The clinical presentation of MMN may mimic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, other variants of motor neuron disease, or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with asymmetric onset. Differentiation is important, as these diseases differ in prognosis and treatment. The electrophysiological finding of conduction block in the absence of abnormalities in sensory nerves is the hallmark of MMN, but can be difficult to detect. Intravenous immunoglobulin is efficacious in most patients, but long-term maintenance therapy does not prevent slowly progressive axonal degeneration. Moreover, cyclophosphamide, although effective, has substantial adverse effects, and the efficacy of other immunosuppressive drugs, including rituximab, is not established. The underlying pathological mechanisms of MMN are unclear, but IgM autoantibodies against the ganglioside GM1 may cause changes in nodal and perinodal structures that compromise nerve conduction. Further elucidation of the disease mechanisms may ultimately lead to improved treatment strategies. In this Review, we discuss the diagnostic criteria for MMN, and provide an update on the current understanding of MMN pathogenesis. We also describe available treatments and promising new therapeutic strategies.},

Afferent muscle spindle response to passive stretch was recorded in ten acute rabbit experiments. A newly proposed first-order model of muscle spindle response to passive sinusoidal muscle stretch manages to capture the relationship between afferent neural firing rate and muscle length. We demonstrate that the model can be used to track random motion trajectories with bandwidth from 0.1 to 1 Hz over a range of 4 mm with a muscle length estimation error of 0.3 mm (1.4 degrees of joint angle). When estimation is performed using four-channel ENG there is a 50{\%} reduction in estimate variation, compared to using single-channel recordings.},

abstract = {Spinal motor neurons have voltage gated ion channels localized in their dendrites that generate plateau potentials. The physical separation of ion channels for spiking from plateau generating channels can result in nonlinear bistable firing patterns. The physical separation and geometry of the dendrites results in asymmetric coupling between dendrites and soma that has not been addressed in reduced models of nonlinear phenomena in motor neurons. We measured voltage attenuation properties of six anatomically reconstructed and type-identified cat spinal motor neurons to characterize asymmetric coupling between the dendrites and soma. We showed that the voltage attenuation at any distance from the soma was direction-dependent and could be described as a function of the input resistance at the soma. An analytical solution for the lumped cable parameters in a two-compartment model was derived based on this finding. This is the first two-compartment modeling approach that directly derived lumped cable parameters from the geometrical and passive electrical properties of anatomically reconstructed neurons.},

abstract = {Impaired balance may limit mobility and daily activities, and plays a key role in the elderly falling. Maintaining balance requires a concerted action of the sensory, nervous and motor systems, whereby cause and effect mutually affect each other within a closed loop. Aforementioned systems and their connecting pathways are prone to chronological age and disease-related deterioration. System redundancy allows for compensation strategies, e.g. sensory reweighting, to maintain standing balance in spite of the deterioration of underlying systems. Once those strategies fail, impaired balance and possible falls may occur. Targeted interventions to prevent falling require knowledge of the quality of the underlying systems and the compensation strategies used. As current clinical balance tests only measure the ability to maintain standing balance and cannot distinguish between cause and effect in a closed loop, there is a clear clinical need for new techniques to assess standing balance. A way to disentangle cause-and-effect relations to identify primary defects and compensation strategies is based on the application of external disturbances and system identification techniques, applicable in clinical practice. This paper outlines the multiple deteriorations of the underlying systems that may be involved in standing balance, which have to be detected early to prevent impaired standing balance. An overview of clinically used balance tests shows that early detection of impaired standing balance and identification of causal mechanisms is difficult with current tests, thereby hindering the development of well-timed and target-oriented interventions as described next. Finally, a new approach to assess standing balance and to detect the underlying deteriorations is proposed.},

abstract = {1. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of a plantarflexor maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) on Achilles tendon moment arm length. 2. Sagittal magnetic resonance (MR) images of the right ankle were taken in six subjects both at rest and during a plantarflexor MVC in the supine position at a knee angle of 90 deg and at ankle angles of -30 deg (dorsiflexed direction), -15 deg, 0 deg (neutral ankle position), +15 deg (plantarflexed direction), +30 deg and +45 deg. A system of mechanical stops, support triangles and velcro straps was used to secure the subject in the above positions. Location of a moving centre of rotation was calculated for ankle rotations from -30 to 0 deg, -15 to +15 deg, 0 to +30 deg and +15 to +45 deg. All instant centres of rotation were calculated both at rest and during MVC. Achilles tendon moment arms were measured at ankle angles of -15, 0, +15 and +30 deg. 3. At any given ankle angle, Achilles tendon moment arm length during MVC increased by 1-1.5 cm (22-27{\%}, P < 0.01) compared with rest. This was attributed to a displacement of both Achilles tendon by 0.6-1.1 cm (P < 0.01) and all instant centres of rotation by about 0.3 cm (P < 0.05) away from their corresponding resting positions. 4. The findings of this study have important implications for estimating loads in the musculoskeletal system. Substantially unrealistic Achilles tendon forces and moments generated around the ankle joint during a plantarflexor MVC would be calculated using resting Achilles tendon moment arm measurements.},

abstract = {Timely delivery of information is essential for proper functioning of the nervous system. Precise regulation of nerve conduction velocity is needed for correct exertion of motor skills, sensory integration and cognitive functions. In vertebrates, the rapid transmission of signals along nerve fibers is made possible by the myelination of axons and the resulting saltatory conduction in between nodes of Ranvier. Myelin is a specialization of glia cells and is provided by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Myelination not only maximizes conduction velocity, but also provides a means to systematically regulate conduction times in the nervous system. Systematic regulation of conduction velocity along axons, and thus systematic regulation of conduction time in between neural areas, is a common occurrence in the nervous system. To date, little is understood about the mechanism that underlies systematic conduction velocity regulation and conduction time synchrony. Node assembly, internode distance (node spacing) and axon diameter - all parameters determining the speed of signal propagation along axons - are controlled by myelinating glia. Therefore, an interaction between glial cells and neurons has been suggested. This review summarizes examples of neural systems in which conduction velocity is regulated by anatomical variations along axons. While functional implications in these systems are not always clear, recent studies on the auditory system of birds and mammals present examples of conduction velocity regulation in systems with high temporal precision and a defined biological function. Together these findings suggest an active process that shapes the interaction between axons and myelinating glia to control conduction velocity along axons. Future studies involving these systems may provide further insight into how specific conduction times in the brain are established and maintained in development. Throughout the text, conduction velocity is used for the speed of signal propagation, i.e. the speed at which an action potential travels. Conduction time refers to the time it takes for a specific signal to travel from its origin to its target, i.e. neuronal cell body to axonal terminal. ?? 2013 IBRO.},

Patients with disabling cramps rated their physical (p< 0.0001) and mental (p= 0.04) quality of life lower than patients without disabling cramps. This study confirms that muscle cramps are common, disabling and associated with reduced quality of life in patients with polyneuropathy. Similar prevalence of cramps across predominant nerve fiber type suggests a role of sensory afferents in cramp generation, although this needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In this report, we describe the necessary elements for a circuit that provides circadian regulation of arousal. Trans-synaptic retrograde tracing revealed a prominent indirect projection from the SCN to the noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC), a brain arousal system. Double-labeling experiments revealed several possible links between the SCN and the LC, including the dorsomedial (DMH) and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (PVN), as well as medial and ventrolateral pre-optic areas. Lesion studies confirmed that the DMH is a substantial relay in this circuit. Next, neurophysiology experiments revealed circadian variations in LC impulse activity. Lesions of the DMH eliminated these circadian changes in LC activity, confirming the functionality of the SCN-DMH-LC circuit. These results reveal mechanisms for regulation of circadian and sleep-waking functions.},

In the experiments described in this paper, the device was used to provide proprioceptive feedback from a virtual prosthetic arm controlled with myoelectric sensors on the bicep and tricep muscles in 15 able-bodied participants. Targeting errors in blind movements with the haptic device were compared to cases where no feedback and contralateral proprioception were provided. Average errors were lower with the device than with no feedback but larger than with contralateral proprioceptive feedback. Participants also had lower visual demand with the device than with no feedback while tracking a 30 moving range. The results indicate that the rotational skin stretch may ultimately be effective for proprioceptive feedback in myoelectric prostheses, particularly when vision is otherwise occupied.},

abstract = {1. Human gastrocnemius medialis architecture was analysed in vivo, by ultrasonography, as a function of joint angle at rest and during voluntary isometric contractions up to the maximum force (MVC). 2. At rest, as ankle joint angle increased from 90 to 150 deg, pennation increased from 15.8 to 27.7 deg, fibre length decreased from 57.0 to 34.0 mm and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) increased from 42.1 to 63.5 cm(2). 3. From rest to MVC, at a fixed ankle joint angle of 110 deg, pennation angle increased from 15.5 to 33.6 deg and fibre length decreased from 50.8 to 32.9 mm, with no significant change in the distance between the aponeuroses. As a result of these changes the PCSA increased by 34.8{\{}{\%}{\}}. 4. Measurements of pennation angle, fibre length and distance between the aponeuroses of the gastrocnemius medialis were also performed by ultrasound on a cadaver leg and found to be in good agreement with direct anatomical measurements. 5. It is concluded that human gastrocnemius medialis architecture is significantly affected both by changes of joint angle at rest and by isometric contraction intensity. The remarkable shortening observed during isometric contraction suggests that, at rest, the gastrocnemius muscle and tendon are considerably slack. The extrapolation of muscle architectural data obtained from cadavers to in vivo conditions should be made only fur matching muscle lengths.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Metabolic flexibility is defined as ability to adjust fuel oxidation to fuel availability. Multiple sclerosis (MS) results in reduced muscle strength and exercise intolerance. We tested the hypothesis that altered metabolic flexibility contributes to exercise intolerance in MS patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We studied 16 patients (all on glatiramer) and 16 matched healthy controls. Energy expenditure (EE), and carbohydrate (COX) and lipid oxidation (LOX) rates were determined by calorimetry, before and after an oral glucose load. We made measurements either at rest (canopy device) or during 40 min low-grade (0.5 W/kg) exercise (metabolic chamber). We also obtained plasma, and adipose tissue and skeletal muscle dialysate samples by microdialysis to study tissue-level metabolism under resting conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: At rest, fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid levels did not differ between patients and controls. Fasting and postprandial COX was higher and LOX lower in patients. In adipose, fasting and postprandial dialysate glucose, lactate, and glycerol levels were higher in patients vs. controls. In muscle, fasting and postprandial dialysate metabolite levels did not differ significantly between the groups. During exercise, EE did not differ between the groups. However, COX increased sharply over 20 min in patients, without reaching a steady state, followed by an immediate decrease within the next 20 min and fell even below basal levels after exercise in patients, compared to controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Glucose tolerance is not impaired in MS patients. At rest, there is no indication for metabolic inflexibility or mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. The increased adipose tissue lipolytic activity might result from glatiramer treatment. Autonomic dysfunction might cause dysregulation of postprandial thermogenesis at rest and lipid mobilization during exercise.},

abstract = {Sudden stretch of active muscle typically results in two characteristic electromyographic responses: the short latency M1 and the long latency M2. The M1 response originates from the monosynaptic Ia afferent reflex pathway. The M2 response is less well understood and is likely a compound response to different afferent inputs mediated by spinal and transcortical pathways. In this study the possible contribution of the Ia afferent pathway to the M2 response was investigated. A mechanism was hypothesized in which the M1 response synchronizes the motoneurons, and therewith their refractory periods. Stretch perturbation experiments were performed on the wrist and results were compared with a computational model of a pool of motoneurons receiving tonic and Ia afferent input. The simulations showed the same stretch amplitude, velocity, and duration-dependent characteristics on the M2 as found experimentally. It was concluded that the stretch duration effect of the M2 likely originates from the proposed Ia afferent mediated mechanism.},

abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome is classified into acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) by electrodiagnostic and pathological criteria. In AMAN, the immune attack appears directed against the axolemma and nodes of Ranvier. Threshold tracking was used to measure indices of axonal excitability (refractoriness, supernormality, and threshold electrotonus) for median nerve axons at the wrist of patients with AMAN (n = 10) and AIDP (n = 8). Refractoriness (the increase in threshold current during the relative refractory period) was greatly increased in AMAN patients, but the abruptness of the threshold increases at short interstimulus intervals indicated conduction failure distal to the stimulation (ie, an increased refractory period of transmission). During the 4 week period from onset, the high refractoriness returned toward normal, and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential increased, consistent with improvement in the safety margin for impulse transmission in the distal nerve. In contrast, refractoriness was normal in AIDP, even though there was marked prolongation of distal latencies. Supernormality and threshold electrotonus were normal in both groups of patients, suggesting that, at the wrist, membrane potential was normal and pathology was relatively minor. These results support the view that the predominantly distal targets of immune attack are different for AMAN and AIDP. Possible mechanisms for the reduced safety factor in AMAN are discussed.},

abstract = {A major presenting symptom in ‘individuals with multiple sclerosis with mild balance disability’ (IwMS) is poor postural control, resulting from slowed spinal somatosensory conduction. Postural control deficits in IwMS are most apparent when vision is removed and the base of support is reduced such is the case during tandem and single support stances. The current study used center of pressure (COP) measurements to determine whether postural control differences exist between IwMS and either ‘healthy age-matched individuals’ (HAMI) or ‘community-dwelling older adults’ (OA). Postural control was evaluated using a Romberg standing task, which required participants to stand with their feet together and hands by their sides for 45 s with either their eyes open or closed. Results revealed that COP velocity root mean square was greater in IwMS and their COP position was closer to their self-selected maximum stability limits (e.g., greater Standing Index proportion) when vision was removed compared to HAMI. Conversely, IwMS displayed similar postural control characteristics to OA. The current study highlights two novel findings: (1) the utility of novel COP measurements to assess differences in the level of postural control in IwMS; and (2) the benefit of assessing postural control levels in IwMS to not only a population with a fully intact and functional postural control system (HAMI) but also to another population that is thought to experience postural control deficits (OA).},

abstract = {Despite intense research, few treatments are available for most neurological disorders. Demyelinating diseases are no exception. This is perhaps not surprising considering the multifactorial nature of these diseases, which involve complex interactions between immune system cells, glia and neurons. In the case of multiple sclerosis, for example, there is no unanimity among researchers about the cause or even which system or cell type could be ground zero. This situation precludes the development and strategic application of mechanism-based therapies. We will discuss how computational modeling applied to questions at different biological levels can help link together disparate observations and decipher complex mechanisms whose solutions are not amenable to simple reductionism. By making testable predictions and revealing critical gaps in existing knowledge, such models can help direct research and will provide a rigorous framework in which to integrate new data as they are collected. Nowadays, there is no shortage of data; the challenge is to make sense of it all. In that respect, computational modeling is 
an invaluable tool that could, ultimately, transform how we understand, diagnose, and treat demyelinating diseases.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of feedback from large-diameter sensory fibers to the adaptation of soleus muscle activity after small ankle trajectory modifications during human walking. Small-amplitude and slow-velocity ankle dorsiflexion enhancements and reductions were applied during the stance phase of the gait cycle to mimic the normal variability of the ankle trajectory during walking. Patients with demyelination of large sensory fibers (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A and antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein neuropathy) and age-matched controls participated in this study. The patients had absent light-touch sense in the toes and feet and absent quadriceps and Achilles tendon reflexes, indicating functional loss of large sensory fibers. Moreover, their soleus stretch reflex response consisted of a single electromyographic (EMG) burst with delayed onset and longer duration (P < 0.01) than the short- and medium-latency reflex responses observed in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the soleus EMG gradually increased or decreased when the ankle dorsiflexion was, respectively, enhanced or reduced. In the patients, the soleus EMG increased during the dorsiflexion enhancements; however, the velocity sensitivity of this response was decreased compared with the healthy volunteers. When the dorsiflexion was reduced, the soleus EMG was unchanged. These results indicate that the enhancement of the soleus EMG is mainly sensitive to feedback from primary and secondary muscle spindle afferents and that the reduction may be mediated by feedback from the group Ib pathways. This study provides evidence for the role of sensory feedback in the continuous adaptation of the soleus activity during the stance phase of human walking.},

abstract = {HCN channels are responsible for I(h), a voltage-gated inwardly rectifying current activated by hyperpolarization. This current appears to be more active in human sensory axons than motor and may play a role in the determination of threshold. Differences in I(h) are likely to be responsible for the high variability in accommodation to hyperpolarization seen in different subjects. The aim of this study was to characterise this current in human axons, both motor and sensory. Recordings of multiple axonal excitability properties were performed in 10 subjects, with a focus on the changes in threshold evoked by longer and stronger hyperpolarizing currents than normally studied. The findings confirm that accommodation to hyperpolarization is greater in sensory than motor axons in all subjects, but the variability between subjects was greater than the modality difference. An existing model of motor axons was modified to take into account the behaviour seen with longer and stronger hyperpolarization, and a mathematical model of human sensory axons was developed based on the data collected. The differences in behaviour of sensory and motor axons and the differences between different subjects are best explained by modulation of the voltage dependence, along with a modest increase of expression of the underlying conductance of I(h). Accommodation to hyperpolarization for the mean sensory data is fitted well with a value of -94.2 mV for the mid-point of activation (V(0.5)) of I(h) as compared to -107.3 mV for the mean motor data. The variation in response to hyperpolarization between subjects is accounted for by varying this parameter for each modality (sensory: -89.2 to -104.2 mV; motor -87.3 to -127.3 mV). These voltage differences are within the range that has been described for physiological modulation of I(h) function. The presence of slowly activated I(h) isoforms on both motor and sensory axons was suggested by modelling a large internodal leak current and a masking of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump activity by a tonic depolarization. In addition to an increased activation of I(h), the modelling suggests that in sensory axons the nodal slow K(+) conductance is reduced, with consequent depolarization of resting membrane potential, and action potential of shorter duration.},

To clarify the physiological abnormalities at the site of the block, we tested the effects induced by polarizing direct currents on motor conduction along forearm nerves in 25 normal nerves (13 subjects), and at the site of conduction block in six nerves (five patients) with MMN. In healthy controls, whereas nerve depolarization failed to change the conditioned compound muscle action potential (CMAP), hyperpolarization elicited a significant, charge-dependent, decrease in the conditioned CMAP size. Hyperpolarization with 4 mC elicited CMAPs that were 86.76 +/- 5.22{\%} (mean +/- SEM) of the control unconditioned response (P < 0.05). Analysis of individual MMN nerves showed that polarizing currents elicited markedly heterogeneous effects: depending on the nerve tested, depolarization or hyperpolarization in most cases significantly improved conduction along motor fibres across the conduction block. In three MMN nerves, pathophysiological abnormalities were consistent with a hyperpolarizing block, in two with a depolarizing block, and in one with a mixed block. Our observations indicate that the pathophysiological abnormalities at the site of conduction block in MMN may arise from depolarization or hyperpolarization, probably depending on the course of disease.},

Because it involves a complex interaction between two of the most intricate biological systems, immune system and CNS, animal modeling has been critical for addressing MS pathogenesis. MS models were originally developed serendipitously more than 75 years ago. Immune-mediated, toxic, viral and genetic models of demyelination are now used to understand the manifold aspects of MS. MS treatments evolved in part from animal model research, and further progress is envisaged in large part because these systems have been continually refined and their use focused on questions whose relevance was established by studying the human disease.},

abstract = {Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is a pure motor axonal subtype of Guillain-Barr?? syndrome (GBS) that was identified in the late 1990s. In Asia and Central and South America, it is the major subtype of GBS, seen in 30-65{\%} of patients. AMAN progresses more rapidly and has an earlier peak than demyelinating GBS; tendon reflexes are relatively preserved or even exaggerated, and autonomic dysfunction is rare. One of the main causes is molecular mimicry of human gangliosides by Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides. In addition to axonal degeneration, electrophysiology shows rapidly reversible nerve conduction blockade or slowing, presumably due to pathological changes at the nodes or paranodes. Autoantibodies that bind to GM1 or GD1a gangliosides at the nodes of Ranvier activate complement and disrupt sodium-channel clusters and axoglial junctions, which leads to nerve conduction failure and muscle weakness. Improved understanding of the disease mechanism and pathophysiology might lead to new treatment options and improve the outlook for patients with AMAN. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nerve conduction block induced by high-frequency biphasic rectangular pulses was analyzed using a lumped circuit model of the myelinated axon based on Frankenhaeuser-Huxley (FH) equations. At the temperature of 37 degrees C, axons of different diameters (2-20 microm) can be blocked completely at supra-threshold intensities when the stimulation frequency is above 10 kHz. However, at stimulation frequencies between 6 kHz and 9 kHz, both nerve block and repetitive firing of action potentials can be observed at different stimulation intensities. When the stimulation frequency is below 6 kHz, nerve block does not occur regardless of stimulation intensity. Larger diameter axons have a lower threshold intensity to induce conduction block. When temperature is reduced from 37 degrees C to 20 degrees C, the lowest frequency to completely block large axons (diameters 10-20 microm) decreased from 8 kHz to 4 kHz. This simulation study can guide future animal experiments as well as optimize stimulation waveforms for electrical nerve block in clinical applications.},

abstract = {Weakness and fatigue are commonly encountered symptoms in neurological disorders and significantly impair quality of life. In the case of motor axons, conduction block contributes to weakness and fatigue and may be associated with aberrant nerve activity including fasciculations and cramp. These symptoms result from dysfunction of the constituent channels and pumps of the axonal membrane. In critically conducting axons, impulse conduction can be impaired by the effects of activity or by other mechanisms that produce a significant shift in membrane potential. Conduction failure may be accentuated or relieved by maneuvers that manipulate the time course of the driving current, including the administration of agents that interfere with Na(+) channel function. In patients with inflammatory neuropathies, normal activity may be sufficient to precipitate conduction failure at sites of impaired function in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). From a clinical perspective, these features are not assessed adequately by conventional neurophysiological techniques. As weakness and fatigue may only develop following activity or exertion, it is useful to assess the effects of impulse trains to determine the extent of conduction failure and the resulting symptoms in neurological patients. These techniques and the physiological mechanisms underlying the development of activity-dependent hyperpolarization will be critically appraised in this review, with a focus on demyelinating neuropathies, MMN and the neurodegenerative disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).},

Despite remarkable advances in our understanding of these diseases, no curative treatment for MNDs exists. To better understand the pathogenesis of MNDs and to help develop new treatments, the establishment of animal models that can be studied efficiently and thoroughly is paramount. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly becoming a valuable model for studying human diseases and in screening for potential therapeutics. In this Review, we highlight recent progress in using zebrafish to study the pathology of the most common MNDs: spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). These studies indicate the power of zebrafish as a model to study the consequences of disease-related genes, because zebrafish homologues of human genes have conserved functions with respect to the aetiology of MNDs. Zebrafish also complement other animal models for the study of pathological mechanisms of MNDs and are particularly advantageous for the screening of compounds with therapeutic potential. We present an overview of their potential usefulness in MND drug discovery, which is just beginning and holds much promise for future therapeutic development.},

abstract = {Converging evidence is consistent with the view that fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis is independent from pyramidal tract involvement, suggesting a possible involvement of frontal areas. During voluntary movement, changes of the EEG rhythms can be observed over sensorimotor areas. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the 10 and 20 Hz frequency bands occurs during motor planning and execution and is followed after movement termination by event-related synchronization (ERS), expressing cortical idling or inhibition. We evaluated the pattern of cortical activation to voluntary movement in MS patients complaining of fatigue assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale. Fifteen MS patients complaining of fatigue, 18 MS patients without fatigue, and 14 normal controls were studied. The two patients groups were similar for age, sex, disease duration, and were not disabled (score <1.5 at the Expanded Disability Status Scale). Twenty-nine channel EEG was recorded during about 60 self-paced extensions of the right thumb. The onset latency and amount of the contralateral sensorimotor (C3 electrode) 10 and 18--22 Hz ERD were similar in the three groups. ERD was more widespread anteriorly in the fatigue group compared with normal controls (P < 0.01 over Fz electrode). Postmovement contralateral sensorimotor 18--22 Hz ERS was significantly lower in fatigue MS patients compared with normal subjects (P < 0.005) and with nonfatigue MS patients (P = 0.02). These findings are consistent with a central origin of fatigue in MS and indicate cortical dysfunction even during a simple motor task, resulting in hyperactivity during movement execution and failure of the inhibitory mechanisms intervening after movement termination.},

abstract = {A clinical and electrophysiological study was performed in 119 Type 1A Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1A) patients with proven 17p11.2 duplication. Onset of the first functional manifestations was in the first decade in 50{\%} of cases and before the age of 20 years in 70{\%} of cases. The predominant clinical signs were muscle weakness and wasting in the lower limbs. None of the patients was normal on clinical examination and all presented at least pes cavus or ankle jerk areflexia. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was uniformly reduced in all nerves, and was < or = 33 m/s in the median nerve for all patients. Sensory potentials were abnormal in all cases, even where there was no clinical sensory loss. Needle electromyography recruitment was reduced in distal muscles for all patients. MNCV slowing was fully consistent with the presence of duplication even in clinically asymptomatic individuals or in children, confirming the complete electrophysiological penetrance of 17p11.2 duplication and making median nerve MNCV a reliable tool for screening affected at-risk individuals. Functional disability was mild. Ninety-six percent of patients were autonomous; 25{\%} were asymptomatic and diagnosed by systematic family investigation especially on the basis of median nerve MNCV reduction. Early age at onset and greatly reduced median nerve MNCV were predictive of a more severe disease course; the earlier the onset the more reduced the median nerve MNCV and the higher the functional disability tended to be after an equivalent disease duration. Cross-sectional analysis of neurological deficit, functional deficit and MNCV according to disease duration showed that, regardless of age at onset, CMT1A disease with 17p11.2 duplication is a clinically progressive disorder. Neurological deficit and functional disability increased, whereas median nerve MNCV and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude did not change with disease course. Intrafamilial phenotype variation between parents and children and between siblings was studied in large families. Functional disability and neurological deficit differed widely and the highest range of median nerve MNCV within a family reached 23 m/s. Clinical and electrophysiological data were compared with those of CMT1B patients with peripheral myelin P0 protein point mutation. CMT1A patients were found to be more severely affected with more prolonged distal motor latency and more reduced CMAP amplitude, whereas MNCV did not significantly differ, indicating that peripheral myelin P0 protein point mutation is not always associated with a severe phenotype. The same genetic defect (17p11.2 duplication) results in variable expression within the phenotype, even in siblings with variations in age at onset, clinical severity and MNCV slowing. This phenotypic variation could be due to additional genetic factors related to peripheral myelin protein 22 expression as well as to other endogenous or environmental factors.},

The molecular mechanisms that lead to defective cytoskeleton architecture in two mouse models of motoneuron disease are summarized and discussed in this manuscript. In the progressive motor neuropathy (pmn) mouse model of motoneuron disease that is caused by a mutation in the tubulin-specific chaperone E gene, death of motoneuron cell bodies appears as a consequence of axonal degeneration. Treatment with bcl-2 overexpression or with glial-derived neurotrophic factor prevents loss of motoneuron cell bodies but does not influence the course of disease. In contrast, treatment with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) significantly delays disease onset and prolongs survival of pmn mice. This difference is due to the activation of Stat-3 via the CNTF receptor complex in axons of pmn mutant motoneurons. Most of the activated Stat-3 protein is not transported to the nucleus to activate transcription, but interacts locally in axons with stathmin, a protein that destabilizes microtubules. This interaction plays a major role in CNTF signaling for microtubule dynamics in axons. In Smn-deficient mice, a model of spinal muscular atrophy, defects in axonal translocation of $\beta$-actin mRNA and possibly other mRNA species have been observed. Moreover, the regulation of local protein synthesis in response to signals from neurotrophic factors and extracellular matrix proteins is altered in motoneurons from this model of motoneuron disease. These findings indicate that local signals are important for maintenance and plasticity of axonal branches and neuromuscular endplates, and that disturbances in these signaling mechanisms could contribute to the pathophysiology of motoneuron diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Balance control under static and dynamic conditions was assessed in patients with Sensory Neuron Disease (SND) in order to shed further light on the pathophysiology of ataxia. METHODS: Fourteen patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and 11 with SND underwent clinical and neurophysiological evaluation, stabilometric recording of body sway during quiet stance with and without vision, stereometric analysis of body segment displacement while riding a platform translating in anterior-posterior direction with and without vision (dynamic condition), and EMG recording of leg muscle responses to abrupt stance perturbation produced by rotation of a supporting platform. The findings were compared to those of age matched normal subjects. RESULTS: Clinical and neurophysiological evaluation revealed a more severe motor impairment in patients with diabetes than SND, while sensory impairment was superimposable. Some patients with SND had vestibular dysfunction of diverse severity. Body sway during stance was larger in patients with SND than diabetes with and without vision. In the stance perturbation condition, the latency of the long-loop EMG response to platform rotation was disproportionately increased with respect to the spinal response in the SND but not in diabetic patients. Under dynamic condition, patients with SND oscillated more than diabetic patients and several of them easily lost balance with eyes closed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SND show severe unsteadiness under both static and dynamic conditions, particularly with eyes closed. The patchy sensory loss of SND, disrupting sensation from territories other than the lower limbs and possibly including the vestibular nerve, could be responsible for this instability. Ataxia is correlated to the abnormal latency of the muscle responses to stance perturbation. Since increased response latencies cannot be attributed to a vestibular deficit, the deterioration of equilibrium control would be ascribed mainly to the degeneration of the central branch of the afferent fibres. SIGNIFICANCE: Measures of body balance under quiet stance and dynamic conditions can provide relevant diagnostic information as to the pathophysiology and severity of ataxia and viability of the central branch of the sensory fibres, and help in separating patients with peripheral neuropathy from patients with loss of sensory neurones.},

This symptom, which can be severely disabling and embarrassing for patients, is difficult to manage. Isoniazid in high doses, carbamazepine, propranolol and gluthetimide have been reported to provide some relief, but published evidence of effectiveness is very limited. Most trials were of small size and of short duration. Cannabinoids appear ineffective. Tremor reduction can be obtained with stereotactic thalamotomy or thalamic stimulation. However, the studies were small and information on long-term functional outcome is scarce. Physiotherapy, tremor reducing orthoses, and limb cooling can achieve some functional improvement. Tremor in MS remains a significant challenge and unmet need, requiring further basic and clinical research.},

Evidence that axonal and neuronal pathology contributes to the disease is accumulating, however, the distribution of neuronal injury as well as the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully clarified. Here, we investigated the role of neuronal cell loss in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). METHODS: We performed electrophysiological investigations in MS patients, including assessment of compound muscle action potentials and motor unit numbers and quantified neuronal cell loss in human MS samples and different EAE models by high-precision stereology. RESULTS: Both electrophysiological and morphological analyses indicated a massive loss of lower motor neurons in MS patients. We regularly found dying spinal motor neurons surrounded by CD3+ (CD4+ as well as CD8+) T cells expressing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). We observed a similar degree of damage and immune attack in different variants of EAE; the lower motor neurons were preserved in adoptive transfer EAE induced with TRAIL-deficient T lymphocytes. INTERPRETATION: Our study indicates that damage to lower motor neurons and TRAIL-mediated inflammatory neurodegeneration in the spinal cord contribute to MS pathology.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Peripheral neuropathies are one of the most common reasons for seeking neurological care in everyday practice. Electrophysi-ological studies remain fundamental for the diagnosis and etiological classification of peripheral nerve impairment. The recent technological development though of high resolution ultrasound has allowed the clinician to obtain detailed structural images of peripheral nerves. Nerve ultrasound mainly focuses on the evaluation of the cross sectional area, cross sectional area variability along the anatomical course, echogenity, vascularity and mobility of the peripheral nerves. An increase of the cross sectional area, hypervascularity, disturbed fascicular echostructure and reduced nerve mobility are some of the most common findings of entrapments neuropathies, such as the carpal or cubital tunnel syndrome. Both the cross-sectional area increase and the hyper-vascularity detected with the Doppler technique seem to correlate significantly with the clinical and electrophysiological severity of the later mononeuropathies. Significantly greater cross sectional area values of the clinically affected cervical nerve root are often detected in cases of cervical radiculopathy. In such cases, the ultrasound findings seem also to correlate significantly with disease duration. On the other hand, multifocal cross sectional area enlargement of cervical roots and/or peripheral nerves is often documented in cases of immune-mediated neuropathies. None of the later pathological ultrasound findings seem to correlate significantly with the electrophysiological parameters or the functional disability. The aim of this review is to provide a timely update on the role of neuromuscular ultrasound in the diagnostic of the most common entrapment and immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies in clinical practice.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess postural stabilization skill in adult subjects affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 1A. For this purpose ground reaction force (GRF) was measured by means of a piezoelectric force platform during the sit-to-stand (STS) movement, until a steady state erect posture was achieved. Specific indexes to quantify Centre of Mass acceleration, both during postural stabilization and during quiet standing, were computed using a mathematical model. Forty-seven CMT1A subjects were recruited for the study, and the control group was formed by forty-one age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The results show that CMT1A subjects are less stable than controls during the quiet stance. Greater difficulty (high values of Yinf, the final instability rate) to maintain erect posture appears to be mainly associated with plantar-flexor muscle weakness, rather than to damage of the proprioceptive system. The worst performances shown by CMT1A subjects in the stabilization phase (high values of I, the global index of postural stabilization performance) seem to be associated with reduced muscle strength and the loss of large sensory nerve fibres. Distal muscle weakness appears to affect both postural stabilization and quiet erect posture. The presented protocol and the analysis of postural stabilization parameters provide useful information on CMT1A balance disorders. © 2014 The Authors.},

We recruited 20 normal subjects and 27 patients affected by neuropathies known to affect to a different extent large and medium size afferent fibres. The patients comprised 5 with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), 8 with CMT type 2 (CMT2) and 14 with Diabetes polyneuropathy (Diabetics). Measurement of balance during quiet stance on a stabilometric platform showed that sway area (SA) was larger in the CMT2 and Diabetics than normal subjects or in CMT1A, under both eyes open and closed conditions. The estimated conduction velocity (CV) of the group II afferent fibres was lower in CMT2 and Diabetics than in normal subjects and CMT1A. Across all patients, SA increased as a function of the slowing of group II CV. During a dynamic balance task the head A-P displacement was only slightly increased in the patient groups with respect to normals, despite the increased delay at which the head followed displacement of the feet. The unpredictably good performance of all patient groups under dynamic condition, which was at variance with their imbalance during quiet stance, may indicate that these patients learnt to exploit anticipatory postural strategies. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The internodally focally demyelinated cases (termed as IFD1, IFD2 and IFD3, respectively, with one, two and three demyelinated internodes are simulated using our previous double cable model of the fibre. The progressively greater increase of focal loss of myelin lamellae blocks the invasion of the intracellular potentials into the demyelinated zones. For all investigated cases, the radial decline of the extracellular potential amplitudes increases with the increase of the radial distance and demyelination, whereas the electrotonic potentials show a decrease in the slow part of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses. The time constants are shorter and the rheobases higher for the IFD2 and IFD3 cases than for the normal case. In the recovery cycles, the same cases have less refractoriness, greater supernormality and less late subnormality than the normal case.

This study investigated the variability present in the sway patterns during quiet standing in patients with MS (PwMS) and healthy controls. Subjects were assessed (eyes open, closed) standing on a force platform. Variability of the sway patterns was quantified using a measure of amount of variability (root mean square; RMS) and two measures of temporal structure of variability (Lyapunov Exponent - LyE; Approximate Entropy - ApEn). RMS results revealed significantly higher amount of variability in the sway patterns of PwMS. PwMS also exhibit increased regularity (decreased ApEn) and decreased divergence (decreased LyE) during standing compared to healthy controls. Removing vision resulted in significantly decreased divergence (decreased LyE) in the MS subject group. These changes in the temporal structure correspond well with the theoretical model of the optimal movement variability hypothesis and the results support using variability measures to understand the mechanisms that underline postural control in PwMS and possibly other neurodegenerative disease pathologies. © 2012.},

abstract = {Observational cohort studies are a powerful tool to assess the long-term outcome in chronic diseases. This study design has been utilized in local and regional outcome studies in multiple sclerosis (MS) and has yielded invaluable epidemiological information. The World Wide Web now provides an excellent opportunity for an international, collaborative cohort study of MS outcomes. A web platform--MSBase--has been designed to collect prospective data on patients with MS. It is purely observational, enabling participating neurologists to contribute data on diagnosis, treatment and progress, to review anonymous aggregate data and to benchmark their patient population against other patient subsets or the entire dataset. MSBase facilitates collaborative research by allowing the online creation of investigator-initiated regional, national and international substudies. The registry aims to answer epidemiological questions that can only be addressed by prospective assessments of large patient cohorts. The registry is funded through the independent MSBase Foundation, and governed by an International Scientific Advisory Board. The MSBase Foundation commenced operations in July 2004 and since then, 22 neurologists from 11 countries have joined MSBase and are contributing 2400 patients to the total data pool.},

abstract = {Neurons send signals to each other by means of sequences of action potentials (spikes). Ignoring variations in spike amplitude and shape that are probably not meaningful to a receiving cell, the information content, or entropy of the signal depends on only the timing of action potentials, and because there is no external clock, only the interspike intervals, and not the absolute spike times, are significant. Estimating spike train entropy is a difficult task, particularly with small data sets, and many methods of entropy estimation have been proposed. Here we present two related model-based methods for estimating the entropy of neural signals and compare them to existing methods. One of the methods is fast and reasonably accurate, and it converges well with short spike time records; the other is impractically time-consuming but apparently very accurate, relying on generating artificial data that are a statistical match to the experimental data. Using the slow, accurate method to generate a best-estimate entropy value, we find that the faster estimator converges to this value more closely and with smaller data sets than many existing entropy estimators.},

abstract = {Threshold tracking was used to compare excitability properties (stimulus-response curves, strength-duration properties, recovery cycle and threshold electrotonus) of the median nerve in 11 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and 25 healthy controls. Stimulus-response curves were significantly different: threshold was much higher, the slope of the curves reduced and the spread of the thresholds greater in the CIDP group. The strength-duration time constant (tau(SD)) was significantly shorter and the rheobase higher in the CIDP group. In the recovery cycle, the CIDP group had less refractoriness, supernormality and late subnormality than healthy controls, but the duration of the relatively refractory period was normal. These changes in tau(SD) and the recovery cycle were not those previously predicted. There were no consistent changes in threshold electrotonus, suggesting that, for the studied axons, there are no consistent changes in accommodation properties that depend on internodal conductances. It is difficult to explain these changes in excitability on the basis of a change in membrane potential, or solely as the result of demyelination, and it is possible that other morphological factors such as variable remyelination and inflammatory oedema affected axonal excitability in the patients.},

Methods Axonal-stimulating single-fibre electromyography was performed in the extensor digitorum communis muscle of 23 patients with GBS, including 13 with the axonal form whose sera had a high titre of serum IgG anti-GM1 or -GD1a antibodies. Results All patients with axonal or demyelinating GBS showed normal or near-normal jitter, and no blocking. Conclusion In both axonal and demyelinating GBS, neuromuscular transmission is not impaired. Our results failed to support the hypothesis that anti-GM1 or -GD1a antibody affects the NMJ. In GBS, impulse transmission is presumably impaired in the motor nerve terminal axons proximal to the NMJ.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate which measures of trunk sway taken during stance and gait tasks are best correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: We studied 37 MS patients (mean age 43. ± 10 years; 76{\%} female; 81{\%} relapsing-remitting MS; mean EDSS score 2.8. ± 1.1). The study protocol comprised the subjective Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and recorded peak-to-peak trunk sway angles and velocities during 14 stance and gait balance tasks. 76 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects served as controls (HCs). Results: Patients had significant more trunk sway than HCs (p< 0.001) and EDSS scores were highly correlated with sway measures in 6 of 14 balance tests (rho. > 0.4; p< 0.001). Patients with normal clinical Romberg and tandem gait tests showed significantly more trunk sway than HCs when standing on one leg eyes open on foam support (p< 0.001). Patients with spinal cord manifestation of MS (n= 27) had higher trunk sway compared to patients without. Mean DHI score of the patients was 30. ± 23.5{\%}. DHI was highly correlated with trunk sway for all two-legged stance tasks in MS patients. Conclusions: Balance deficits in trunk sway observed in MS patients during stance and gait tasks are highly correlated with their EDSS and DHI scores, with stance and tandem gait tasks providing the highest correlations. Measures of trunk sway during stance balance tests demonstrate a MS-related functional deficit even in patients with normal clinical Romberg and tandem gait tests, and therefore have the potential to provide objective data of sub-clinical deficits. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Converging evidence is consistent with the view that fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis is independent from pyramidal tract involvement, suggesting a possible involvement of frontal areas. During voluntary movement, changes of the EEG rhythms can be observed over sensorimotor areas. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the 10 and 20 Hz frequency bands occurs during motor planning and execution and is followed after movement termination by event-related synchronization (ERS), expressing cortical idling or inhibition. We evaluated the pattern of cortical activation to voluntary movement in MS patients complaining of fatigue assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale. Fifteen MS patients complaining of fatigue, 18 MS patients without fatigue, and 14 normal controls were studied. The two patients groups were similar for age, sex, disease duration, and were not disabled (score <1.5 at the Expanded Disability Status Scale). Twenty-nine channel EEG was recorded during about 60 self-paced extensions of the right thumb. The onset latency and amount of the contralateral sensorimotor (C3 electrode) 10 and 18--22 Hz ERD were similar in the three groups. ERD was more widespread anteriorly in the fatigue group compared with normal controls (P < 0.01 over Fz electrode). Postmovement contralateral sensorimotor 18--22 Hz ERS was significantly lower in fatigue MS patients compared with normal subjects (P < 0.005) and with nonfatigue MS patients (P = 0.02). These findings are consistent with a central origin of fatigue in MS and indicate cortical dysfunction even during a simple motor task, resulting in hyperactivity during movement execution and failure of the inhibitory mechanisms intervening after movement termination.},

abstract = {Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in multiple sclerosis but is poorly understood. We investigated 'physiological' fatigue in 21 patients with multiple sclerosis who complained of disabling fatigue by measuring the decline in strength during a 45 s maximal contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle. The results were compared with those from a control group of 19 healthy subjects. The strength of control subjects declined by approximately 20{\%} during the contraction; twitch interpolation showed central drive remained almost maximal throughout, and therefore that the fatigue was peripheral in origin. Patients had normal baseline strength, but developed greater fatigue (approximately 45{\%}), which was central in origin. In both cases, the decline in strength followed a roughly linear time course suggesting that the patients, like the normals, were trying to maintain a maximum voluntary effort. Evidence for frequency-dependent conduction block (FDCB) in the patients' central motor pathways was sought by measuring the EMG responses to single and paired transcranial magnetic stimuli. Fatigue had no effect on the latency or size of EMG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting that FDCB was unlikely to have occurred. This was supported by measurements of the maximum speed of voluntary muscle contraction; although the patients showed relatively slow speeds before exercise, the decline in speed after fatigue was no greater than in normal subjects. We conclude that excessive 'physiological' fatigue contributes to the symptom of fatigue in multiple sclerosis and is central in origin. However, since the degree of exercise-induced fatigue did not correlate with the baseline complaint of fatigue, other factors must also be operating to produce the full range of clinical symptoms. We found no conclusive evidence that central fatigue is related to increased dysfunction in the primary central motor pathways and no evidence that FDCB is the pathophysiological mechanism. We postulate that central fatigue in multiple sclerosis is due to impaired drive to the primary motor cortex and several lines of evidence strongly suggest that this is not due to a lack of motivation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomedical research is changing due to the rapid accumulation of experimental data at an unprecedented scale, revealing increasing degrees of complexity of biological processes. Life Sciences are facing a transition from a descriptive to a mechanistic approach that reveals principles of cells, cellular networks, organs, and their interactions across several spatial and temporal scales. There are two conceptual traditions in biological computational-modeling. The bottom-up approach emphasizes complex intracellular molecular models and is well represented within the systems biology community. On the other hand, the physics-inspired top-down modeling strategy identifies and selects features of (presumably) essential relevance to the phenomena of interest and combines available data in models of modest complexity. RESULTS: The workshop, "ESF Exploratory Workshop on Computational disease Modeling", examined the challenges that computational modeling faces in contributing to the understanding and treatment of complex multi-factorial diseases. Participants at the meeting agreed on two general conclusions. First, we identified the critical importance of developing analytical tools for dealing with model and parameter uncertainty. Second, the development of predictive hierarchical models spanning several scales beyond intracellular molecular networks was identified as a major objective. This contrasts with the current focus within the systems biology community on complex molecular modeling. CONCLUSION: During the workshop it became obvious that diverse scientific modeling cultures (from computational neuroscience, theory, data-driven machine-learning approaches, agent-based modeling, network modeling and stochastic-molecular simulations) would benefit from intense cross-talk on shared theoretical issues in order to make progress on clinically relevant problems.},

In most patients, the disease follows a relapsing-remitting course and is characterized by dynamic inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the CNS. Although on the surface MS may appear consistent with a primary autoimmune disease, questions have been raised as to whether inflammation and/or autoimmunity are really at the root of the disease, and it has been proposed that MS might in fact be a degenerative disorder. We argue that MS may be an 'immunological convolution' between an underlying primary degenerative disorder and the host's aberrant immune response. To better understand this disease, we might need to consider non-inflammatory primary progressive MS as the 'real' MS, with inflammatory forms reflecting secondary, albeit very important, reactions.},

Here, we investigated the subjective postural vertical (SPV) and visual vertical (SVV) in three patients with bilateral somatosensory deafferentation and a group of age-matched normal subjects. Our hypothesis was that the patients with bilateral somatosensory deafferentation may show tilt induced bias in the construction of their SPV, with a normal SVV. Patient 1 had a severe Guillain Barr{\'{e}} syndrome and almost complete absence of peripheral sensation, the two other patients had a thoracic spinal injury with a sensory loss from T6-7 down. On initial testing, compared with normal subjects and the patients with spinal injury, Patient 1 had a significant bias in SPV towards the side of a preceding tilt in both directions. Several months later, after significant improvement of sensation, this tilt-induced bias in SPV had resolved completely. In addition, Patient 1 had a significantly enlarged "cone of verticality", which did not change following improvement in peripheral sensation, reflecting persisting disturbance in the perception of body verticality. In the two patients with spinal injury, bias towards the side of a preceding tilt was not significant.

Ten individuals with MS and ten age-and-gender matched healthy subjects stood on the force platform with eyes open or closed. The displacements of center of pressure (COP) were used to calculate power spectrum using fast Fourier transform. Power spectrum was analyzed for anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions using three frequency bands: 0-0.3 Hz, 0.3-1 Hz, and 1-3 Hz reflecting contributions from the visual, vestibular/somatosensory, and proprioceptive systems, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean COP velocity in the eyes closed condition was significantly larger for the MS than the healthy control group. Additionally, the MS group showed a significant decrease in the magnitude of COP power spectrum in the low frequency band and a pattern of increase in the medium and high frequency bands in the medial-lateral direction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The observed redistribution of the COP power spectrum when vision is absent indicates that people with MS relied more on the vestibular/somatosensory and proprioceptive systems. However, such a strategy change was ineffective in maintaining postural stability, thus highlighting the impaired ability of the somatosensory system in regulation of postural control in people with MS. The outcome of the study suggests that the COP frequency analysis could be used in identifying the possible sources of balance impairment in people with MS.},

Threshold electrotonus was used to study whether altered membrane properties of the median nerve at the wrist (intermediate segment) are associated with clinical profiles in 21 CIDP patients. In response to hyperpolarizing conditioning stimuli, the threshold changes were significantly greater for CIDP patients than for normal controls (n = 49). The pattern was similar to that of 11 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1a, who exhibited abnormally high thresholds to hyperpolarizing currents. The abnormal threshold electrotonus was present in 48{\%} of the CIDP patients and was associated with longer disease duration, more severe disability, poorer response to immune treatments, and slower nerve conduction velocities. Threshold electrotonus can be used to detect demyelination at the tested sites and may provide new information about pathophysiology and distribution patterns of demyelination in CIDP.},

abstract = {Despite similar computational approaches, there is surprisingly little interaction between the computational neuroscience and the systems biology research communities. In this review I reconstruct the history of the two disciplines and show that this may explain why they grew up apart. The separation is a pity, as both fields can learn quite a bit from each other. Several examples are given, covering sociological, software technical, and methodological aspects. Systems biology is a better organized community which is very effective at sharing resources, while computational neuroscience has more experience in multiscale modeling and the analysis of information processing by biological systems. Finally, I speculate about how the relationship between the two fields may evolve in the near future.},

@article{Howells2012,
abstract = {HCN channels are responsible for I(h), a voltage-gated inwardly rectifying current activated by hyperpolarization. This current appears to be more active in human sensory axons than motor and may play a role in the determination of threshold. Differences in I(h) are likely to be responsible for the high variability in accommodation to hyperpolarization seen in different subjects. The aim of this study was to characterise this current in human axons, both motor and sensory. Recordings of multiple axonal excitability properties were performed in 10 subjects, with a focus on the changes in threshold evoked by longer and stronger hyperpolarizing currents than normally studied. The findings confirm that accommodation to hyperpolarization is greater in sensory than motor axons in all subjects, but the variability between subjects was greater than the modality difference. An existing model of motor axons was modified to take into account the behaviour seen with longer and stronger hyperpolarization, and a mathematical model of human sensory axons was developed based on the data collected. The differences in behaviour of sensory and motor axons and the differences between different subjects are best explained by modulation of the voltage dependence, along with a modest increase of expression of the underlying conductance of I(h). Accommodation to hyperpolarization for the mean sensory data is fitted well with a value of -94.2 mV for the mid-point of activation (V(0.5)) of I(h) as compared to -107.3 mV for the mean motor data. The variation in response to hyperpolarization between subjects is accounted for by varying this parameter for each modality (sensory: -89.2 to -104.2 mV; motor -87.3 to -127.3 mV). These voltage differences are within the range that has been described for physiological modulation of I(h) function. The presence of slowly activated I(h) isoforms on both motor and sensory axons was suggested by modelling a large internodal leak current and a masking of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump activity by a tonic depolarization. In addition to an increased activation of I(h), the modelling suggests that in sensory axons the nodal slow K(+) conductance is reduced, with consequent depolarization of resting membrane potential, and action potential of shorter duration.},

abstract = {Objective: To elucidate the features of sensory nerve involvement in Fisher syndrome (FS), this study extensively investigated sensory electrophysiology. Methods: In 47 consecutive FS patients, results of sensory nerve conduction studies in the median, ulnar and sural nerves, soleus H-reflexes, and median or tibial somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) were reviewed. Because of the large effects of age on amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP), we strictly defined reduction of SNAP amplitudes by using a nomogram which age and amplitude obtained from 87normal subjects. Results: In routine nerve conduction studies, SNAP amplitude was reduced only in 32{\%} of the patients, and conduction velocity was decreased in 2{\%}. In contrast, soleus H-reflexes were frequently absent or reduced (67{\%}). SEPs were abnormal only in 17{\%}. Conclusions: In FS, absent soleus H-reflexes are the most frequent electrophysiologic abnormalities, whereas SNAPs amplitudes are rarely affected. The pattern is characterized by predominant involvement of group Ia afferents with relatively preserved cutaneous afferents without evidence suggestive of demyelination. Significance: The major targets of immune attack by anti-GQ1b antibodies in FS appear to be group Ia neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, and this is presumably responsible for ataxia and areflexia in FS. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Patients with intention tremor due to multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibit an increased reliance on visual feedback in the sensorimotor control of slow goal-directed movements. In the present study, the use of proprioceptive information was investigated in MS patients with intention tremor compared to MS patients without tremor and healthy controls. Tendon vibration was applied to the wrist extensor muscles during a memory-guided slow wrist step-tracking task to investigate the use of muscle spindle afferent information in online movement control. A significant reduction of movement amplitude was induced by tendon vibration in all three groups, but the effect was found to be smaller in MS patients with tremor (28{\%}) than in subjects without tremor (50{\%}). Vibration also induced an increase of overall tremor amplitude in the MS tremor group; however, its effect on movement amplitude was not directly related to (changes in) tremor severity. The results suggest that the decreased online use of proprioceptive information in MS patients with tremor reflects an adaptation over time to cope with a tremor-related noisy background. Abnormalities in proprioceptive processing may explain why MS patients with tremor show an increased reliance on visual feedback for online motor control.},

abstract = {In order to determine the influence of somatosensory impairments, due to the loss of large myelinated fibres, on the postural stability of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT) patients, a cross-sectional balance assessment was done. Nine CMT patients were compared with eight patients with a distal type of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), and 11 healthy control subjects. The balance assessment consisted of four tasks: quiet barefoot standing on a stable versus compliant surface, with eyes opened or closed. Force plate signals were used to calculate the velocity of the centre of pressure of the ground reaction forces. The patients' distal muscle force (MRC scale), vibration detection threshold (Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork) and superficial tactile sensation (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments) were clinically assessed. Compared to the healthy subjects, postural stability of both patient groups was seriously impaired, however, increased visual dependency was only found in the CMT patients. The postural instability of the CMT patients correlated significantly with decreased vibration sense only. The strength of the correlation increased with task complexity. It is concluded that somatosensory deficits substantially contribute to impaired postural stability and increased visual dependency in CMT patients. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess postural stabilization skill in adult subjects affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 1A. For this purpose ground reaction force (GRF) was measured by means of a piezoelectric force platform during the sit-to-stand (STS) movement, until a steady state erect posture was achieved. Specific indexes to quantify Centre of Mass acceleration, both during postural stabilization and during quiet standing, were computed using a mathematical model. Forty-seven CMT1A subjects were recruited for the study, and the control group was formed by forty-one age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The results show that CMT1A subjects are less stable than controls during the quiet stance. Greater difficulty (high values of Yinf, the final instability rate) to maintain erect posture appears to be mainly associated with plantar-flexor muscle weakness, rather than to damage of the proprioceptive system. The worst performances shown by CMT1A subjects in the stabilization phase (high values of I, the global index of postural stabilization performance) seem to be associated with reduced muscle strength and the loss of large sensory nerve fibres. Distal muscle weakness appears to affect both postural stabilization and quiet erect posture. The presented protocol and the analysis of postural stabilization parameters provide useful information on CMT1A balance disorders. © 2014 The Authors.},

Why myelin repair fails in multiple sclerosis is currently unclear; however, new understanding of the generation of oligodendrocytes and myelination during development, as well as an increasing understanding of the bases of successful remyelination, are providing new insights and therapeutic targets. We propose that successful myelin repair of the adult CNS recapitulates a sequence of stages that generally correlate with those seen during development, whereas unsuccessful myelin repair results from the perturbation of a critical process in any one of several sequential events. Defining the rate-limiting steps and most vulnerable aspects at each stage of myelin repair will provide logical targets for therapeutic intervention in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.},

abstract = {Although current knowledge attributes movement disorders to a dysfunction of the basal ganglia-motor cortex circuits, abnormalities in the peripheral afferent inputs or in their central processing may interfere with motor program execution. We review the abnormalities of sensorimotor integration described in the various types of movement disorders. Several observations, including those of parkinsonian patients' excessive reliance on ongoing visual information during movement tasks, suggest that proprioception is defective in Parkinson's disease (PD). The disturbance of proprioceptive regulation, possibly related to the occurrence of abnormal muscle-stretch reflexes, might be important for generating hypometric or bradykinetic movements. Studies with somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), prepulse inhibition, and event-related potentials support the hypothesis of central abnormalities of sensorimotor integration in PD. In Huntington's disease (HD), changes in SEPs and long-latency stretch reflexes suggest that a defective gating of peripheral afferent input to the brain might impair sensorimotor integration in cortical motor areas, thus interfering with the processing of motor programs. Defective motor programming might contribute to some features of motor impairment in HD. Sensory symptoms are frequent in focal dystonia and sensory manipulation can modify the dystonic movements. In addition, specific sensory functions (kinaesthesia, spatial-temporal discrimination) can be impaired in patients with focal hand dystonia, thus leading to a "sensory overflow." Sensory input may be abnormal and trigger focal dystonia, or defective "gating" may cause an input-output mismatch in specific motor programs. Altogether, several observations strongly support the idea that sensorimotor integration is impaired in focal dystonia. Although elemental sensation is normal in patients with tics, tics can be associated with sensory phenomena. Some neurophysiological studies suggest that an altered "gating" mechanism also underlies the development of tics. This review underlines the importance of abnormal sensorimotor integration in the pathophysiology of movement disorders. Although the physiological mechanism remains unclear, the defect is of special clinical relevance in determining the development of focal dystonia},

Methods: We studied 37 MS patients (mean age 43. ± 10 years; 76{\%} female; 81{\%} relapsing-remitting MS; mean EDSS score 2.8. ± 1.1). The study protocol comprised the subjective Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and recorded peak-to-peak trunk sway angles and velocities during 14 stance and gait balance tasks. 76 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects served as controls (HCs). Results: Patients had significant more trunk sway than HCs (p< 0.001) and EDSS scores were highly correlated with sway measures in 6 of 14 balance tests (rho. > 0.4; p< 0.001). Patients with normal clinical Romberg and tandem gait tests showed significantly more trunk sway than HCs when standing on one leg eyes open on foam support (p< 0.001). Patients with spinal cord manifestation of MS (n= 27) had higher trunk sway compared to patients without. Mean DHI score of the patients was 30. ± 23.5{\%}. DHI was highly correlated with trunk sway for all two-legged stance tasks in MS patients. Conclusions: Balance deficits in trunk sway observed in MS patients during stance and gait tasks are highly correlated with their EDSS and DHI scores, with stance and tandem gait tasks providing the highest correlations. Measures of trunk sway during stance balance tests demonstrate a MS-related functional deficit even in patients with normal clinical Romberg and tandem gait tests, and therefore have the potential to provide objective data of sub-clinical deficits. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In multiple sclerosis, a common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, immune-mediated axon damage is responsible for permanent neurological deficits. How axon damage is initiated is not known. Here we use in vivo imaging to identify a previously undescribed variant of axon damage in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. This process, termed 'focal axonal degeneration' (FAD), is characterized by sequential stages, beginning with focal swellings and progressing to axon fragmentation. Notably, most swollen axons persist unchanged for several days, and some recover spontaneously. Early stages of FAD can be observed in axons with intact myelin sheaths. Thus, contrary to the classical view, demyelination-a hallmark of multiple sclerosis-is not a prerequisite for axon damage. Instead, focal intra-axonal mitochondrial pathology is the earliest ultrastructural sign of damage, and it precedes changes in axon morphology. Molecular imaging and pharmacological experiments show that macrophage-derived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) can trigger mitochondrial pathology and initiate FAD. Indeed, neutralization of ROS and RNS rescues axons that have already entered the degenerative process. Finally, axonal changes consistent with FAD can be detected in acute human multiple sclerosis lesions. In summary, our data suggest that inflammatory axon damage might be spontaneously reversible and thus a potential target for therapy.},

abstract = {The investigation of multiple nerve membrane properties by mathematical models has become a new tool to study peripheral neuropathies. In demyelinating neuropathies, the membrane properties such as potentials (intracellular, extracellular, electrotonic) and indices of axonal excitability (strength-duration time constants, rheobases and recovery cycles) can now be measured at the peripheral nerves. This study provides numerical simulations of the membrane properties of human motor nerve fibre in cases of internodal, paranodal and simultaneously of paranodal internodal demyelinations, each of them mild systematic or severe focal. The computations use our previous multi-layered model of the fibre. The results show that the abnormally greater increase of the hyperpolarizing electrotonus, shorter strength-duration time constants and greater axonal superexcitability in the recovery cycles are the characteristic features of the mildly systematically demyelinated cases. The small decrease of the polarizing electrotonic responses in the demyelinated zone in turn leads to a compensatory small increase of these responses outside the demyelinated zone of all severely focally demyelinated cases. The paper summarizes the insights gained from these modeling studies on the membrane property abnormalities underlying the variation in clinical symptoms of demyelination in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome and multifocal motor neuropathy. The model used provides an objective study of the mechanisms of these diseases which up till now have not been sufficiently well understood, because quite different assumptions have been given in the literature for the interpretation of the membrane property abnormalities obtained in hereditary, chronic and acquired demyelinating neuropathies.},

Needle electrode examination usually reveals early recruitment of short duration motor unit potentials, often with fibrillation potentials. In CIP, the findings are usually those of a generalized axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Direct muscle stimulation aids in differentiating CIP and CIM and in identifying mixed disorders along with other electrodiagnostic and histopathologic studies.

Objectives: To examine the association between spasticity and postural control in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Motor control laboratory. Participants: Subjects with MS (n=16, 2 male) and age and sex-matched subjects (n=16) participated in the investigation. All subjects with MS had Expanded Disability Status Scale scores between 0 and 4.5 and modified Ashworth scale scores between 1 and 3. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Postural control was measured with a force platform that quantifies ground reaction forces and moments in mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. Postural control was indexed with anterior-posterior sway range, medial-lateral sway range, 95{\%} elliptical area of the deviations of center of pressure (COP), velocity of COP sway, and the frequency at which 95{\%} of spectral profile was contained. Participants with MS further underwent assessment of the soleus Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) as an index of spasticity. Results: Cluster analysis on H-reflex data identified groups of MS participants with high spasticity (n=7) and low spasticity (n=9). There were no differences in age, duration of MS, and disease severity between MS groups. There were no differences in anterior-posterior sway range between any of the groups. The high spasticity group had greater COP area, velocity, and mediolateral sway compared with the low spasticity and control group, and the low spasticity group had postural control values between the high spasticity and control groups. Conclusions: The pattern of results suggests that spasticity contributes to postural deficits observed in MS. ?? 2010 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {Axonal Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) was first described by Feasby et al. in 1986, challenging the existent notion of GBS being a primarily demyelinating disease. The severe course and slow recovery commonly seen in these patients was ascribed to axonal degeneration. Other authors challenged this claim on several grounds. Amidst these controversies, epidemics of a similar illness were reported from China, which were given the acronym AMAN, having exclusive motor involvement in contrast to the cases already described in which both motor and sensory involvement were present (AMSAN). Pathologically, Wallerian degeneration, minimal lymphocytic response, absent demyelination or inflammation and periaxonal macrophages are prominent features. Ultrastructural studies have revealed node of Ranvier to be the prime target of immune attack. A frequent occurrence of antecedent Campylobacter jejuni infection and a strong association between elevated titres of IgG GM1 and axonal GBS on a background of preceding C. jejuni infection has been observed and molecular mimicry between lipopolysaccharides of C. jejuni and neural epitopes has been proposed as a mechanism of injury. Clinically axonal variant is similar to AIDP, but a more severe course, with frequent respiratory involvement, ventilator dependence and significant residue may be seen. Diagnosis is essentially electrophysiological. Treatment is similar to AIDP, preferential benefit of either IVIG or plasmapheresis needs to be further evaluated.

Muscle strength, central and peripheral activation, and symptomatic fatigue were investigated in 16 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 18 control subjects. Voluntary and electrically stimulated isometric contractions were obtained from the ankle dorsiflexor muscles. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was 27{\%} lower in MS patients than controls, although electrically stimulated force was similar. Muscle fat-free cross-sectional area (CSA) was similar in both groups. These data indicate central activation impairment in MS. Such impairment in MS was further demonstrated by decreased foot-tap speed, rate of voluntary force development, and central activation ratio. Peripheral activation changes in MS patients were modest. Although stimulated tetanic force was similar, force relaxation was slower in MS patients compared to controls, resulting in a left-shifted force-frequency relationship in MS. Motor function changes were not associated with fatigue but were associated with impaired ambulation. Thus, weakness and walking impairment, but not fatigue, were related to impaired central activation in MS. These findings may help optimize rehabilitation strategies designed to improve function in persons with MS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Balance control under static and dynamic conditions was assessed in patients with Sensory Neuron Disease (SND) in order to shed further light on the pathophysiology of ataxia. METHODS: Fourteen patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and 11 with SND underwent clinical and neurophysiological evaluation, stabilometric recording of body sway during quiet stance with and without vision, stereometric analysis of body segment displacement while riding a platform translating in anterior-posterior direction with and without vision (dynamic condition), and EMG recording of leg muscle responses to abrupt stance perturbation produced by rotation of a supporting platform. The findings were compared to those of age matched normal subjects. RESULTS: Clinical and neurophysiological evaluation revealed a more severe motor impairment in patients with diabetes than SND, while sensory impairment was superimposable. Some patients with SND had vestibular dysfunction of diverse severity. Body sway during stance was larger in patients with SND than diabetes with and without vision. In the stance perturbation condition, the latency of the long-loop EMG response to platform rotation was disproportionately increased with respect to the spinal response in the SND but not in diabetic patients. Under dynamic condition, patients with SND oscillated more than diabetic patients and several of them easily lost balance with eyes closed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SND show severe unsteadiness under both static and dynamic conditions, particularly with eyes closed. The patchy sensory loss of SND, disrupting sensation from territories other than the lower limbs and possibly including the vestibular nerve, could be responsible for this instability. Ataxia is correlated to the abnormal latency of the muscle responses to stance perturbation. Since increased response latencies cannot be attributed to a vestibular deficit, the deterioration of equilibrium control would be ascribed mainly to the degeneration of the central branch of the afferent fibres. SIGNIFICANCE: Measures of body balance under quiet stance and dynamic conditions can provide relevant diagnostic information as to the pathophysiology and severity of ataxia and viability of the central branch of the sensory fibres, and help in separating patients with peripheral neuropathy from patients with loss of sensory neurones.},

Some of the reasons for this lack of progress include the persistence of outdated concepts, the misinterpretation of experimental recordings, and a failure to embrace a global perspective on fatigue. This paper summarizes the three examples of these limitations that were discussed in the 2011 Muybridge Award lecture: motor unit types and muscle fatigue, myoelectric manifestations of fatigue, and fatigue and fatigability. Although the motor units in a population do exhibit a range of fatigability values, there are not distinct groups of motor units and the concept that some motor units are resistant to fatigue emerged from protocols in which motor units were activated by electrical stimulation rather than voluntary activation. The concept of distinct motor unit types should be abandoned. The second example discussed in the lecture was the use of surface EMG signals to assess fatigue-related adjustments in motor unit activity. The critical assumption with this approach is that the association between surface EMG amplitude and muscle force remains constant during fatiguing contractions. Unfortunately, the relation does not remain constant and a series of computational studies demonstrate the magnitude of the discrepancy, including the absence of an association with the activation signal emerging from the spinal cord and that received by the muscle. The third example concerned the concepts of fatigue and fatigability. It has long been recognized that fatigue involves both sensations and impairments in motor function, and the final part of the lecture urged the integration of the two constructs into a single scheme in which fatigue can be modulated either independently or by interactions between perceptions of fatigue and the mechanisms that establish levels of fatigability. The expectation is that such critical evaluations of the concepts and approaches to the study of fatigue will provide a more effective foundation from which to identify the factors that contribute to fatigue in health and disease.},

abstract = {The transmission and processing of pain signals relies critically on the activities of ion channels that are expressed in afferent pain fibers. This includes voltage-gated channels, as well as background (or leak) channels that collectively regulate resting membrane potential and action potential firing properties. Dysregulated ion channel expression in response to nerve injury and inflammation results in enhanced neuronal excitability that underlies chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Pharmacological modulators of ion channels, particularly those that target channels on peripheral neurons, are being pursued as possible analgesics. Over the past few years, a number of different types of ion channels have been implicated in afferent pain signaling. Here we give an overview of recent advances on sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride channels that are emerging as especially attractive targets for the treatment of pain.},

We developed geometrically and electrically accurate models of mammalian motor nerve fibers to gain insight into the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the changes in axonal excitability and regulate the recovery cycle. The models developed in this study incorporated a double cable structure, with explicit representation of the nodes of Ranvier, paranodal, and internodal sections of the axon as well as a finite impedance myelin sheath. These models were able to reproduce a wide range of experimental data on the excitation properties of mammalian myelinated nerve fibers. The combination of an accurate representation of the ion channels at the node (based on experimental studies of human, cat, and rat) and matching the geometry of the paranode, internode, and myelin to measured morphology (necessitating the double cable representation) were needed to match the model behavior to the experimental data. Following an action potential, the models generated both depolarizing (DAP) and hyperpolarizing (AHP) afterpotentials. The model results support the hypothesis that both active (persistent Na(+) channel activation) and passive (discharging of the internodal axolemma through the paranodal seal) mechanisms contributed to the DAP, while the AHP was generated solely through active (slow K(+) channel activation) mechanisms. The recovery cycle of the fiber was dependent on the DAP and AHP, as well as the time constant of activation and inactivation of the fast Na(+) conductance. We propose that experimentally documented differences in the action potential shape, strength-duration relationship, and the recovery cycle of motor and sensory nerve fibers can be attributed to kinetic differences in their nodal Na(+) conductances.},

abstract = {Our objective was to investigate how cooling of the arm and vision influence pointing movements in healthy subjects and patients with cerebellar limb ataxia due to clinically proven multiple sclerosis. An infrared video motion analysis system was used to record the unrestricted, horizontal pointing movements toward a target under three different conditions involving a moving, stationary, or imaginary target; a visual, or acoustic trigger; and vision or memory guidance. All three tasks were performed before and after cooling the arm in ice water. Patients had more hypermetric and slower pointing movements than controls under all tested conditions. Patients also had significantly larger three-dimensional finger sway paths during the postural phase and larger movement angles of the wrist joint. Memory-guided movements were the most hypermetric recorded in both groups. Cooling of the limb had no effect on amplitude or peak velocity of the pointing movement in either group under all tested conditions, but significantly reduced the three-dimensional finger sway path during the postural phase in patients with limb ataxia. Cooling-induced reduction of the finger sway was largest in those patients with the largest finger sway before cooling. In conclusion, the cooling-induced reduction of the proprioceptive afferent inflow, most probably of group I spindle afferents, reduces postural tremor of patients with cerebellar dysfunction.},

abstract = {Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are highly specialized glial cells that wrap axons with a multilayered myelin membrane for rapid impulse conduction. Investigators have recently identified axonal signals that recruit myelin-forming Schwann cells from an alternate fate of simple axonal engulfment. This is the evolutionary oldest form of axon-glia interaction, and its function is unknown. Recent observations suggest that oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells not only myelinate axons but also maintain their long-term functional integrity. Mutations in the mouse reveal that axonal support by oligodendrocytes is independent of myelin assembly. The underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood; we do know that to maintain axonal integrity, mammalian myelin-forming cells require the expression of some glia-specific proteins, including CNP, PLP, and MAG, as well as intact peroxisomes, none of which is necessary for myelin assembly. Loss of glial support causes progressive axon degeneration and possibly local inflammation, both of which are likely to contribute to a variety of neuronal diseases in the central and peripheral nervous systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to control balance is often compromised in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is considered to be a strong contributing factor toward their increased risk of falls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nNEW METHOD: The aim of the study was to demonstrate that frequency analysis of postural sway could be used to investigate postural control in people with MS. Ten individuals with MS and ten age-and-gender matched healthy subjects stood on the force platform with eyes open or closed. The displacements of center of pressure (COP) were used to calculate power spectrum using fast Fourier transform. Power spectrum was analyzed for anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions using three frequency bands: 0-0.3 Hz, 0.3-1 Hz, and 1-3 Hz reflecting contributions from the visual, vestibular/somatosensory, and proprioceptive systems, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mean COP velocity in the eyes closed condition was significantly larger for the MS than the healthy control group. Additionally, the MS group showed a significant decrease in the magnitude of COP power spectrum in the low frequency band and a pattern of increase in the medium and high frequency bands in the medial-lateral direction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The observed redistribution of the COP power spectrum when vision is absent indicates that people with MS relied more on the vestibular/somatosensory and proprioceptive systems. However, such a strategy change was ineffective in maintaining postural stability, thus highlighting the impaired ability of the somatosensory system in regulation of postural control in people with MS. The outcome of the study suggests that the COP frequency analysis could be used in identifying the possible sources of balance impairment in people with MS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occurrence of residual neuropathy and its self-reported health consequences in a population-based group of patients with Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS) and to characterize quantitatively the concomitant motor, sensory, and autonomic impairments. METHODS: Forty patients (mean age 46 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of GBS were studied a mean of 7 years (range 1 to 13 years) after the acute attack together with 40 healthy control subjects. The Dyck minimal criteria of neuropathy, the Neuropathy Symptom Score, the Neuropathy Disability Score, the Short Form-36 (SF-36) generic health questionnaire, isokinetic dynamometry at ankle and wrist, quantitative sensory testing of thresholds for vibration, cold, and pain, autonomic function tests, nerve conduction studies, and a summed Neuropathy Rank Sum Score (NRSS) were applied. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (48{\%}) had residual neuropathy, which was independent of follow-up time. The patients with GBS reported lower health status than control subjects on the SF-36 Physical Component Summary Scale (PCS; p = 0.01), and the PCS scores correlated with the NRSS (r = -0.41, p = 0.009). In patients with GBS, muscle strength at ankle dorsal flexion was reduced by 13.9{\%} (p = 0.001), sensory thresholds for vibration were increased in the foot (p < 0.05), and sensory thresholds for cold were increased in the hand and foot (p < 0.05), whereas autonomic functions and pain thresholds were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Residual neuropathy affecting large- and medium-sized myelinated fibers endures long after the acute attack of Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome in approximately half of all patients, leads to motor and sensory dysfunction, and shows a trend toward impairing self-reported physical health status.},

abstract = {Neurons send signals to each other by means of sequences of action potentials (spikes). Ignoring variations in spike amplitude and shape that are probably not meaningful to a receiving cell, the information content, or entropy of the signal depends on only the timing of action potentials, and because there is no external clock, only the interspike intervals, and not the absolute spike times, are significant. Estimating spike train entropy is a difficult task, particularly with small data sets, and many methods of entropy estimation have been proposed. Here we present two related model-based methods for estimating the entropy of neural signals and compare them to existing methods. One of the methods is fast and reasonably accurate, and it converges well with short spike time records; the other is impractically time-consuming but apparently very accurate, relying on generating artificial data that are a statistical match to the experimental data. Using the slow, accurate method to generate a best-estimate entropy value, we find that the faster estimator converges to this value more closely and with smaller data sets than many existing entropy estimators.},

Here, we investigated the subjective postural vertical (SPV) and visual vertical (SVV) in three patients with bilateral somatosensory deafferentation and a group of age-matched normal subjects. Our hypothesis was that the patients with bilateral somatosensory deafferentation may show tilt induced bias in the construction of their SPV, with a normal SVV. Patient 1 had a severe Guillain Barr{\'{e}} syndrome and almost complete absence of peripheral sensation, the two other patients had a thoracic spinal injury with a sensory loss from T6-7 down. On initial testing, compared with normal subjects and the patients with spinal injury, Patient 1 had a significant bias in SPV towards the side of a preceding tilt in both directions. Several months later, after significant improvement of sensation, this tilt-induced bias in SPV had resolved completely. In addition, Patient 1 had a significantly enlarged "cone of verticality", which did not change following improvement in peripheral sensation, reflecting persisting disturbance in the perception of body verticality. In the two patients with spinal injury, bias towards the side of a preceding tilt was not significant. These findings confirm the importance of somatosensory input from the trunk to the perception of SPV in the seated position. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Axonal swellings are almost universal in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Concussions and traumatic brain injuries can also produce cognitive and behavioral deficits by compromising neuronal morphology. Using a spike metric analysis, we characterize computationally the effects of such axonal varicosities on spike train propagation by comparing Poisson spike train classes before and after propagation through a prototypical axonal enlargement, or focused axonal swelling. Misclassification of spike train classes and low-pass filtering of firing rate activity increases with more pronounced axonal injury. We show that confusion matrices and a calculation of the loss of transmitted information provide a very practical way to characterize how injured neurons compromise the signal processing and faithful conductance of spike trains. The method demonstrates that (i) neural codes encoded with low firing rates are more robust to injury than those encoded with high firing rates, (ii) classification depends upon the length of the spike train used to encode information, and (iii) axonal injuries reduce the variance of spike trains within a given stimulus class. The work introduces a novel theoretical and computational framework to quantify the interplay between electrophysiological dynamics with focused axonal swellings generated by injury or other neurodegenerative processes. It further suggests how pharmacology and plasticity may play a role in recovery of neural computation. Ultimately, the work bridges vast experimental observations of in vitro morphological pathologies with post-traumatic cognitive and behavioral dysfunction.},

This study investigated the variability present in the sway patterns during quiet standing in patients with MS (PwMS) and healthy controls. Subjects were assessed (eyes open, closed) standing on a force platform. Variability of the sway patterns was quantified using a measure of amount of variability (root mean square; RMS) and two measures of temporal structure of variability (Lyapunov Exponent - LyE; Approximate Entropy - ApEn). RMS results revealed significantly higher amount of variability in the sway patterns of PwMS. PwMS also exhibit increased regularity (decreased ApEn) and decreased divergence (decreased LyE) during standing compared to healthy controls. Removing vision resulted in significantly decreased divergence (decreased LyE) in the MS subject group. These changes in the temporal structure correspond well with the theoretical model of the optimal movement variability hypothesis and the results support using variability measures to understand the mechanisms that underline postural control in PwMS and possibly other neurodegenerative disease pathologies. © 2012.},

In muscle, fasting and postprandial dialysate metabolite levels did not differ significantly between the groups. During exercise, EE did not differ between the groups. However, COX increased sharply over 20 min in patients, without reaching a steady state, followed by an immediate decrease within the next 20 min and fell even below basal levels after exercise in patients, compared to controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Glucose tolerance is not impaired in MS patients. At rest, there is no indication for metabolic inflexibility or mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. The increased adipose tissue lipolytic activity might result from glatiramer treatment. Autonomic dysfunction might cause dysregulation of postprandial thermogenesis at rest and lipid mobilization during exercise.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by inflammation and degeneration within the CNS. Over the course of the disease, most MS patients successively accumulate inflammatory lesions, axonal damage, and a rather diffuse CNS pathology, along with an increasing degree of disability. Pharmacological treatment options which are currently approved for MS aim at limiting inflammation and decreasing the relapse rate, or at simply relieving symptoms. Established disease-modifying and immunosuppressive treatments are unable to prevent the accumulation of pathology in most patients over long-term. Therefore, therapies promoting the innate ability of the CNS to compensate for dysfunction resulting from brain injury might be highly beneficial in MS. As a precondition, however, development of such strategies requires well-grounded knowledge about the extent to which central plasticity is intact and accessible in MS patients, and whether it is functionally relevant at all. This review will focus on plasticity of the motor system in patients with MS. A number of functional imaging studies have assessed patterns of brain activation during simple motor tasks in MS patients and their relationship with CNS damage and motor function. Deeper insights about causal and functional relationships were gained by neurophysiological techniques, predominantly by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In addition, and probably closest to rehabilitative approaches, practice-induced plasticity has been probed in a few studies. Altogether, there is growing evidence for a preservation of rapid-onset motor plasticity and for functionally relevant chronic reorganization processes, which might be limited by high CNS injury in advanced stages of the disease. Clinical implications of these findings with regard to the development and optimization of rehabilitative treatments in MS are discussed, as well as open questions which need to be addressed by future studies. ?? 2014 IBRO.},

abstract = {The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for conduction block in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) are still unclear. To clarify the physiological abnormalities at the site of the block, we tested the effects induced by polarizing direct currents on motor conduction along forearm nerves in 25 normal nerves (13 subjects), and at the site of conduction block in six nerves (five patients) with MMN. In healthy controls, whereas nerve depolarization failed to change the conditioned compound muscle action potential (CMAP), hyperpolarization elicited a significant, charge-dependent, decrease in the conditioned CMAP size. Hyperpolarization with 4 mC elicited CMAPs that were 86.76 +/- 5.22{\%} (mean +/- SEM) of the control unconditioned response (P < 0.05). Analysis of individual MMN nerves showed that polarizing currents elicited markedly heterogeneous effects: depending on the nerve tested, depolarization or hyperpolarization in most cases significantly improved conduction along motor fibres across the conduction block. In three MMN nerves, pathophysiological abnormalities were consistent with a hyperpolarizing block, in two with a depolarizing block, and in one with a mixed block. Our observations indicate that the pathophysiological abnormalities at the site of conduction block in MMN may arise from depolarization or hyperpolarization, probably depending on the course of disease.},

abstract = {Objectives: To compare the gait pattern in patients affected by different types of neuropathy. Methods: We recruited healthy subjects (HS, n=38), patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) (n=10) and patients with diabetic neuropathy (DNP) (n=12). Neuropathy impairment score and neuropathy score were assessed. Body sway during quiet stance, and spatio-temporal gait parameters were recorded. Results: Most patients had reduced or absent tendon-tap reflexes. Strength of foot dorsiflexor muscles (p<. 0.05) and conduction velocity (CV) of leg nerves (p<. 0.0001) were more impaired in CMT1A than DNP, whereas joint-position sense was more affected (p<. 0.05) in DNP. Body sway while standing was larger in DNP compared to CMT1A and HS (p<. 0.01 and p<. 0.0001 respectively). During gait, the distribution of foot sole contact pressure was abnormal in CMT1A (p<. 0.05) but not in DNP. Velocity and step length were decreased, and foot yaw angle at foot flat increased, in DNP with respect to CMT1A and HS (both variables, p<. 0.001). Gait velocity and step length were decreased (p<. 0.005) also in CMT1A, but to a smaller extent than in DNP, so that the difference between patient groups was significant (p<. 0.0005). Duration of the double support was protracted in DNP compared to CMT1A and HS (p<. 0.0005). For DNP only, velocity of gait and duration of single support were correlated (p<. 0.05) both to sway path and lower limb muscle strength. Conclusions: Changes in both body sway and stance phase of gait were larger in DNP than CMT1A, indicating more impaired static and dynamic control of balance when neuropathy affects the small in addition to the large afferent fibres. Diminished somatosensory input from the smaller fibres rather than muscle weakness or foot deformity plays a critical role in the modulation of the support phase of gait. Significance: The analysis of balance and gait in patients with neuropathy can offer a tool for understanding the nature and functional impact of the neuropathy and should be included in their functional evaluation. ?? 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare inflammatory neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive, asymmetric distal limb weakness without sensory loss. The clinical presentation of MMN may mimic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, other variants of motor neuron disease, or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with asymmetric onset. Differentiation is important, as these diseases differ in prognosis and treatment. The electrophysiological finding of conduction block in the absence of abnormalities in sensory nerves is the hallmark of MMN, but can be difficult to detect. Intravenous immunoglobulin is efficacious in most patients, but long-term maintenance therapy does not prevent slowly progressive axonal degeneration. Moreover, cyclophosphamide, although effective, has substantial adverse effects, and the efficacy of other immunosuppressive drugs, including rituximab, is not established. The underlying pathological mechanisms of MMN are unclear, but IgM autoantibodies against the ganglioside GM1 may cause changes in nodal and perinodal structures that compromise nerve conduction. Further elucidation of the disease mechanisms may ultimately lead to improved treatment strategies. In this Review, we discuss the diagnostic criteria for MMN, and provide an update on the current understanding of MMN pathogenesis. We also describe available treatments and promising new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {The functional implications of central motor impairment and peripheral muscle alterations in multiple sclerosis are unclear. Muscle strength, central and peripheral activation, and symptomatic fatigue were investigated in 16 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 18 control subjects. Voluntary and electrically stimulated isometric contractions were obtained from the ankle dorsiflexor muscles. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was 27{\%} lower in MS patients than controls, although electrically stimulated force was similar. Muscle fat-free cross-sectional area (CSA) was similar in both groups. These data indicate central activation impairment in MS. Such impairment in MS was further demonstrated by decreased foot-tap speed, rate of voluntary force development, and central activation ratio. Peripheral activation changes in MS patients were modest. Although stimulated tetanic force was similar, force relaxation was slower in MS patients compared to controls, resulting in a left-shifted force-frequency relationship in MS. Motor function changes were not associated with fatigue but were associated with impaired ambulation. Thus, weakness and walking impairment, but not fatigue, were related to impaired central activation in MS. These findings may help optimize rehabilitation strategies designed to improve function in persons with MS.},

abstract = {Background: Sensory assessments are included in clinical and research practice in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). However, their characteristics and relevance in relation to motor involvement and function have rarely been studied. Objectives: To investigate the characteristics and correlates of sensory function in CIDP. Methods: We evaluated the sensory clinical and electrophysiological features in 31 clinically-stabilized, prospectively recruited, CIDP patients and analyzed their relation with motor strength and function as well as with electrophysiology. Results: Sensory function primarily affected large fibres and was predominant in the lower limbs. Sensory Sum Scores (SSS) correlated with Medical Research Council (MRC) motor scores, Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scores (ONLS) and presence of positive sensory symptoms, in upper and lower limbs. Rydel-Seiffer vibration scores correlated with MRC and ONLS scores, in the lower limbs only. Correlations of SSS with sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes and summated compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, were present in the lower limbs but not in the upper limbs, whereas such correlations were ascertained in all extremities for Rydel-Seiffer scores. SNAPs correlated with ONLS scores exclusively in the legs. Conclusions: These results show that sensory involvement relates to motor function in CIDP, suggesting that the disease activity affects concurrently motor and sensory fibres in the disorder. The findings of this cross-sectional analysis may otherwise suggest the practical reliability and usefulness of clinical sensory scores, particularly the SSS, in monitoring disease progression and effects of treatment in the disorder. Further longitudinal study is required to confirm this. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sosnoff JJ, Shin S, Motl RW. Multiple sclerosis and postural control: the role of spasticity. Objectives: To examine the association between spasticity and postural control in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Motor control laboratory. Participants: Subjects with MS (n=16, 2 male) and age and sex-matched subjects (n=16) participated in the investigation. All subjects with MS had Expanded Disability Status Scale scores between 0 and 4.5 and modified Ashworth scale scores between 1 and 3. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Postural control was measured with a force platform that quantifies ground reaction forces and moments in mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. Postural control was indexed with anterior-posterior sway range, medial-lateral sway range, 95{\%} elliptical area of the deviations of center of pressure (COP), velocity of COP sway, and the frequency at which 95{\%} of spectral profile was contained. Participants with MS further underwent assessment of the soleus Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) as an index of spasticity. Results: Cluster analysis on H-reflex data identified groups of MS participants with high spasticity (n=7) and low spasticity (n=9). There were no differences in age, duration of MS, and disease severity between MS groups. There were no differences in anterior-posterior sway range between any of the groups. The high spasticity group had greater COP area, velocity, and mediolateral sway compared with the low spasticity and control group, and the low spasticity group had postural control values between the high spasticity and control groups. Conclusions: The pattern of results suggests that spasticity contributes to postural deficits observed in MS. ?? 2010 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {A major presenting symptom in ‘individuals with multiple sclerosis with mild balance disability’ (IwMS) is poor postural control, resulting from slowed spinal somatosensory conduction. Postural control deficits in IwMS are most apparent when vision is removed and the base of support is reduced such is the case during tandem and single support stances. The current study used center of pressure (COP) measurements to determine whether postural control differences exist between IwMS and either ‘healthy age-matched individuals’ (HAMI) or ‘community-dwelling older adults’ (OA). Postural control was evaluated using a Romberg standing task, which required participants to stand with their feet together and hands by their sides for 45 s with either their eyes open or closed. Results revealed that COP velocity root mean square was greater in IwMS and their COP position was closer to their self-selected maximum stability limits (e.g., greater Standing Index proportion) when vision was removed compared to HAMI. Conversely, IwMS displayed similar postural control characteristics to OA. The current study highlights two novel findings: (1) the utility of novel COP measurements to assess differences in the level of postural control in IwMS; and (2) the benefit of assessing postural control levels in IwMS to not only a population with a fully intact and functional postural control system (HAMI) but also to another population that is thought to experience postural control deficits (OA).},

abstract = {In order to determine the influence of somatosensory impairments, due to the loss of large myelinated fibres, on the postural stability of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT) patients, a cross-sectional balance assessment was done. Nine CMT patients were compared with eight patients with a distal type of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), and 11 healthy control subjects. The balance assessment consisted of four tasks: quiet barefoot standing on a stable versus compliant surface, with eyes opened or closed. Force plate signals were used to calculate the velocity of the centre of pressure of the ground reaction forces. The patients' distal muscle force (MRC scale), vibration detection threshold (Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork) and superficial tactile sensation (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments) were clinically assessed. Compared to the healthy subjects, postural stability of both patient groups was seriously impaired, however, increased visual dependency was only found in the CMT patients. The postural instability of the CMT patients correlated significantly with decreased vibration sense only. The strength of the correlation increased with task complexity. It is concluded that somatosensory deficits substantially contribute to impaired postural stability and increased visual dependency in CMT patients. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Previous findings of altered connectivity patterns led to the hypothesis that the distortion of functional connections within the brain-muscle circuit plays a crucial pathogenic role.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to identify markers sensitive to fatigue in multiple sclerosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Structural (magnetic resonance imaging with assessment of thalamic volume and cortical thickness of the primary sensorimotor areas) and functional (cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) from simultaneous electroencephalo- and surface electromyographic recordings during a weak handgrip task) measures were used on 20 mildly disabled MS patients (relapsing-remitting course, Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤ 2) who were recruited in two fatigue-dependent groups according to the Modified Fatigue Index Scale (MFIS) score.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The two groups were similar in terms of demographic, clinical and imaging features, as well as task execution accuracy and weariness. In the absence of any fatigue-dependent brain and muscular oscillatory activity alterations, CMC worked at higher frequencies as fatigue increased, explaining 67{\%} of MFIS variance (p=.002).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Brain-muscle functional connectivity emerged as a sensitive marker of phenomena related to the origin of MS fatigue, impacting central-peripheral communication well before the appearance of any impairment in the communicating nodes.},

abstract = {Motor disability in MS is commonly assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Categorical rating scales are limited by subjective error and inter-rater variability. Therefore, objective and quantitative measures of motor disability may be useful to supplement the EDSS in the setting of clinical trials. It was previously shown that grip-force-variability (GFV) is increased in MS. We hypothesized that GFV may be an objective measure of motor disability in MS. To investigate whether the increase in GFV in MS is correlated to the clinical disability as assessed by the EDSS and to microstructural changes in the brain as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging, GFV was recorded in a grasping and lifting task in 27 MS patients and 23 controls using a grip-device equipped with a force transducer. The EDSS was assessed by neurologists experienced in MS. Patients underwent diffusion tensor imaging at 3T to assess the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cerebral white matter as a measure of microstructural brain integrity. GFV was increased in MS and correlated to changes in the FA of white matter in the vicinity of the somatosensory and visual cortex. GFV also correlated with the EDSS. GFV may be a useful objective measure of motor dysfunction in MS linked to disability and structural changes in the brain. Our data suggests that GFV should be further explored as an objective measure of motor dysfunction in MS. It could supplement the EDSS, e.g., in proof of concept studies.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients suffer from impaired muscle activation and lower limb strength. Strength training enhances muscle activation and muscle strength, but neural adaptations to strength training remain unexplored in MS patients. The hypothesis was that maximal strength training (MST) using high loads and few repetitions would improve central neural drive and thus strength capacity of MS patients. 14 MS patients staying at a national MS rehabilitation center were randomly assigned to a MST group or a control group (CG). Both groups received "today's treatment". In addition, the MST group trained 4 x 4 repetitions of unilateral dynamic leg press and plantar flexion 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Neural adaptations of the soleus muscle were assessed by surface electromyography (EMG) activity, and by superimposed H-reflexes and V-waves obtained during maximum voluntary isometric plantar flexor contractions (MVCs). H-reflexes and V-waves were normalized by the M-wave (H(SUP)/M(SUP), V/M(SUP), respectively). In the MST group, MVC increased by 20 +/- 9{\%} (P < 0.05). Soleus EMG activity and V/M(SUP) ratio increased by 40 and 55{\%}, respectively, in the MST group compared to the CG (P <or= 0.05). The H(SUP)/M(SUP) ratio remained unchanged. No change was apparent in the CG. MST group subjects were able to complete all training sessions. No adverse effects were reported. This randomized study provides evidence that MST is effective of augmenting the magnitude of efferent motor output of spinal motor neurons in MS patients, alleviating some neuromuscular symptoms linked to the disease.},

abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS) is an acute, post-infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune peripheral neuropathy with a highly diverse clinical course and outcome. We classified GBS on the basis of patients' first nerve conduction and validated this system to be associated with outcome on the basis of electrophysiological characteristics during the acute phase of GBS. We retrospectively evaluated 40 GBS patients who underwent their first electrophysiological study within 14 days of onset and classified GBS into four patterns: (1) acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) pattern with sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor-sensory AIDP: MS-AIDP), (2) AIDP pattern without sensory nerve conduction abnormalities (motor AIDP: M-AIDP), (3) acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) pattern, and (4) minor abnormalities pattern. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory findings between groups and determined subgroups associated with poor outcome. The MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns more frequently exhibited prolonged recovery compared with the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns and were associated with prolonged recovery (specificity, 100 {\%}; sensitivity, 73 {\%}; P < 0.001). The period of inability to walk independently was significantly longer in the MS-AIDP and AMAN patterns than in the M-AIDP and minor abnormalities patterns (median 85 vs. 10 days; P < 0.001). In conclusion, our classification of GBS using a single nerve conduction study in the early phase of disease is associated with outcomes. This classification can be used to counsel individual patients and guide decision-making with respect to treatment.},

abstract = {Despite intense research, few treatments are available for most neurological disorders. Demyelinating diseases are no exception. This is perhaps not surprising considering the multifactorial nature of these diseases, which involve complex interactions between immune system cells, glia and neurons. In the case of multiple sclerosis, for example, there is no unanimity among researchers about the cause or even which system or cell type could be ground zero. This situation precludes the development and strategic application of mechanism-based therapies. We will discuss how computational modeling applied to questions at different biological levels can help link together disparate observations and decipher complex mechanisms whose solutions are not amenable to simple reductionism. By making testable predictions and revealing critical gaps in existing knowledge, such models can help direct research and will provide a rigorous framework in which to integrate new data as they are collected. Nowadays, there is no shortage of data; the challenge is to make sense of it all. In that respect, computational modeling is 
an invaluable tool that could, ultimately, transform how we understand, diagnose, and treat demyelinating diseases.},

abstract = {Muscle cramps are common in the general population and can be disabling for patients, but there is little evidence comprehensively evaluating cramp characteristics in patients with polyneuropathy. This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of muscle cramps in this patient group. Patients over 18 diagnosed with polyneuropathy were invited to join the study. Patients completed nerve conduction studies, the Toronto Clinical Neuropathy score, neuropathy-specific Vickrey's Quality of Life Assessment and a self-administered questionnaire examining demographics, neuropathy symptoms and cramp characteristics. Two hundred and twenty-five participants were enrolled (28.0{\%} female). Sixty-three percent of patients experienced cramps, occurring on average 6 times per week, lasting 10.5. min and scoring 6 out of 10 on a pain scale and described as disabling by 43.6{\%} of patients. No significant difference was found in cramp prevalence according to underlying pathophysiology (p= 0.52) or fiber type (p= 0.41). Patients with disabling cramps rated their physical (p< 0.0001) and mental (p= 0.04) quality of life lower than patients without disabling cramps. This study confirms that muscle cramps are common, disabling and associated with reduced quality of life in patients with polyneuropathy. Similar prevalence of cramps across predominant nerve fiber type suggests a role of sensory afferents in cramp generation, although this needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomedical research is changing due to the rapid accumulation of experimental data at an unprecedented scale, revealing increasing degrees of complexity of biological processes. Life Sciences are facing a transition from a descriptive to a mechanistic approach that reveals principles of cells, cellular networks, organs, and their interactions across several spatial and temporal scales. There are two conceptual traditions in biological computational-modeling. The bottom-up approach emphasizes complex intracellular molecular models and is well represented within the systems biology community. On the other hand, the physics-inspired top-down modeling strategy identifies and selects features of (presumably) essential relevance to the phenomena of interest and combines available data in models of modest complexity. RESULTS: The workshop, "ESF Exploratory Workshop on Computational disease Modeling", examined the challenges that computational modeling faces in contributing to the understanding and treatment of complex multi-factorial diseases. Participants at the meeting agreed on two general conclusions. First, we identified the critical importance of developing analytical tools for dealing with model and parameter uncertainty. Second, the development of predictive hierarchical models spanning several scales beyond intracellular molecular networks was identified as a major objective. This contrasts with the current focus within the systems biology community on complex molecular modeling. CONCLUSION: During the workshop it became obvious that diverse scientific modeling cultures (from computational neuroscience, theory, data-driven machine-learning approaches, agent-based modeling, network modeling and stochastic-molecular simulations) would benefit from intense cross-talk on shared theoretical issues in order to make progress on clinically relevant problems.},

abstract = {Axonal and neuronal injury and loss are of critical importance for permanent clinical disability in multiple sclerosis patients. Axonal injury occurs already early during the disease and accumulates with disease progression. It is not restricted to focal demyelinated lesions in the white matter, but also affects the normal appearing white matter and the grey matter. Experimental studies show that many different immunological mechanisms may lead to axonal and neuronal injury, including antigen-specific destruction by specific T-cells and auto-antibodies as well as injury induced by products of activated macrophages and microglia. They all appear to be relevant for multiple sclerosis pathogensis in different patients and at different stages of the disease. However, in MS lesions a major mechanism of axonal and neuronal damage appears to be related to the action of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which may induce neuronal injury through impairment of mitochondrial function and subsequent energy failure. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A clinical and electrophysiological study was performed in 119 Type 1A Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1A) patients with proven 17p11.2 duplication. Onset of the first functional manifestations was in the first decade in 50{\%} of cases and before the age of 20 years in 70{\%} of cases. The predominant clinical signs were muscle weakness and wasting in the lower limbs. None of the patients was normal on clinical examination and all presented at least pes cavus or ankle jerk areflexia. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was uniformly reduced in all nerves, and was < or = 33 m/s in the median nerve for all patients. Sensory potentials were abnormal in all cases, even where there was no clinical sensory loss. Needle electromyography recruitment was reduced in distal muscles for all patients. MNCV slowing was fully consistent with the presence of duplication even in clinically asymptomatic individuals or in children, confirming the complete electrophysiological penetrance of 17p11.2 duplication and making median nerve MNCV a reliable tool for screening affected at-risk individuals. Functional disability was mild. Ninety-six percent of patients were autonomous; 25{\%} were asymptomatic and diagnosed by systematic family investigation especially on the basis of median nerve MNCV reduction. Early age at onset and greatly reduced median nerve MNCV were predictive of a more severe disease course; the earlier the onset the more reduced the median nerve MNCV and the higher the functional disability tended to be after an equivalent disease duration. Cross-sectional analysis of neurological deficit, functional deficit and MNCV according to disease duration showed that, regardless of age at onset, CMT1A disease with 17p11.2 duplication is a clinically progressive disorder. Neurological deficit and functional disability increased, whereas median nerve MNCV and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude did not change with disease course. Intrafamilial phenotype variation between parents and children and between siblings was studied in large families. Functional disability and neurological deficit differed widely and the highest range of median nerve MNCV within a family reached 23 m/s. Clinical and electrophysiological data were compared with those of CMT1B patients with peripheral myelin P0 protein point mutation. CMT1A patients were found to be more severely affected with more prolonged distal motor latency and more reduced CMAP amplitude, whereas MNCV did not significantly differ, indicating that peripheral myelin P0 protein point mutation is not always associated with a severe phenotype. The same genetic defect (17p11.2 duplication) results in variable expression within the phenotype, even in siblings with variations in age at onset, clinical severity and MNCV slowing. This phenotypic variation could be due to additional genetic factors related to peripheral myelin protein 22 expression as well as to other endogenous or environmental factors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Balance control under static and dynamic conditions was assessed in patients with Sensory Neuron Disease (SND) in order to shed further light on the pathophysiology of ataxia. METHODS: Fourteen patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and 11 with SND underwent clinical and neurophysiological evaluation, stabilometric recording of body sway during quiet stance with and without vision, stereometric analysis of body segment displacement while riding a platform translating in anterior-posterior direction with and without vision (dynamic condition), and EMG recording of leg muscle responses to abrupt stance perturbation produced by rotation of a supporting platform. The findings were compared to those of age matched normal subjects. RESULTS: Clinical and neurophysiological evaluation revealed a more severe motor impairment in patients with diabetes than SND, while sensory impairment was superimposable. Some patients with SND had vestibular dysfunction of diverse severity. Body sway during stance was larger in patients with SND than diabetes with and without vision. In the stance perturbation condition, the latency of the long-loop EMG response to platform rotation was disproportionately increased with respect to the spinal response in the SND but not in diabetic patients. Under dynamic condition, patients with SND oscillated more than diabetic patients and several of them easily lost balance with eyes closed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SND show severe unsteadiness under both static and dynamic conditions, particularly with eyes closed. The patchy sensory loss of SND, disrupting sensation from territories other than the lower limbs and possibly including the vestibular nerve, could be responsible for this instability. Ataxia is correlated to the abnormal latency of the muscle responses to stance perturbation. Since increased response latencies cannot be attributed to a vestibular deficit, the deterioration of equilibrium control would be ascribed mainly to the degeneration of the central branch of the afferent fibres. SIGNIFICANCE: Measures of body balance under quiet stance and dynamic conditions can provide relevant diagnostic information as to the pathophysiology and severity of ataxia and viability of the central branch of the sensory fibres, and help in separating patients with peripheral neuropathy from patients with loss of sensory neurones.},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to assess the potentially different effects of impaired proprioceptive input in balance control under static and dynamic conditions in neuropathic patients. We recruited 20 normal subjects and 27 patients affected by neuropathies known to affect to a different extent large and medium size afferent fibres. The patients comprised 5 with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), 8 with CMT type 2 (CMT2) and 14 with Diabetes polyneuropathy (Diabetics). Measurement of balance during quiet stance on a stabilometric platform showed that sway area (SA) was larger in the CMT2 and Diabetics than normal subjects or in CMT1A, under both eyes open and closed conditions. The estimated conduction velocity (CV) of the group II afferent fibres was lower in CMT2 and Diabetics than in normal subjects and CMT1A. Across all patients, SA increased as a function of the slowing of group II CV. During a dynamic balance task the head A-P displacement was only slightly increased in the patient groups with respect to normals, despite the increased delay at which the head followed displacement of the feet. The unpredictably good performance of all patient groups under dynamic condition, which was at variance with their imbalance during quiet stance, may indicate that these patients learnt to exploit anticipatory postural strategies. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Boe SG, Rice CL, Doherty TJ. Estimating contraction level using root mean square amplitude in control subjects and patients with neuromuscular disorders. Objectives: To assess the utility of the surface electromyographic signal as a means of estimating the level of muscle force during quantitative electromyography studies by examining the relationship between muscle force and the amplitude of the surface electromyographic activity signal; and to determine the impact of a reduction in the number of motor units on this relationship, through inclusion of a sample of patients with neuromuscular disease. Design: Cross-sectional, cohort study design. Setting: Tertiary care, ambulatory, electromyography laboratory. Participants: A volunteer, convenience sample of healthy control subjects (n=10), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n=9), and patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type X (n=5). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and biceps brachii muscles were examined. Force values (at 10{\%} increments) were calculated from two 4-second maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Surface electromyographic activity was recorded during separate 4-second voluntary contractions at 9 force increments (10{\%} -90{\%} of MVC). Additionally, a motor unit number estimate was derived for each subject to quantify the degree of motor unit loss in patients relative to control subjects. Results: The relationships between force and surface electromyographic activity for both muscles (controls and patients) were best fit by a linear function. The variability about the grouped regression lines was quantified by 95{\%} confidence intervals and found to be ??6.7{\%} (controls) and ??8.5{\%} (patients) for the FDI and ??5{\%} (controls) and ??6.1{\%} (patients) for the biceps brachii. Conclusions: These results suggest that the amplitude of the surface electromyographic activity signal may be used as a means of estimating the level of muscle force during quantitative electromyography studies. Future studies should be directed at examining if the variability associated with these force and surface electromyographic activity relationships is acceptable in replacing previous methods of measuring muscle force. ?? 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic and often disabling sensory motor neuropathy postulated as caused by an immune attack against peripheral nerve myelin. In addition to a classic sensory–motor polyneuropathy, other phenotypes of CIDP have been described including the Lewis- Sumner syndrome, distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) neuropathy, pure motor CIDP, pure sensory CIDP including chronic immune sensory polyradiculopathy (CISP), and focal CIDP. These phenotypes are currently considered to be variants of CIDP, even if the possibility that they represent different demyelinating neuropathies cannot be fully excluded considering differences in their response to therapy. Several data support the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of CIDP even if the precise targets and actors (antibodies and lymphocytes) of this immune response remain uncertain. Recent studies have shown that the therapeutic response may differ in patients with peculiar clinical presentations supporting the hypothesis that different pathogenetic mechanisms may underlie the heterogeneity of CIDP. The majority of patients with CIDP show improvement after immune therapies including corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). It remains unclear why none of the other immune therapies that were reported to be variably effective in other immune disorders proved to be effective also in CIDP.},

abstract = {Timely delivery of information is essential for proper functioning of the nervous system. Precise regulation of nerve conduction velocity is needed for correct exertion of motor skills, sensory integration and cognitive functions. In vertebrates, the rapid transmission of signals along nerve fibers is made possible by the myelination of axons and the resulting saltatory conduction in between nodes of Ranvier. Myelin is a specialization of glia cells and is provided by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Myelination not only maximizes conduction velocity, but also provides a means to systematically regulate conduction times in the nervous system. Systematic regulation of conduction velocity along axons, and thus systematic regulation of conduction time in between neural areas, is a common occurrence in the nervous system. To date, little is understood about the mechanism that underlies systematic conduction velocity regulation and conduction time synchrony. Node assembly, internode distance (node spacing) and axon diameter - all parameters determining the speed of signal propagation along axons - are controlled by myelinating glia. Therefore, an interaction between glial cells and neurons has been suggested. This review summarizes examples of neural systems in which conduction velocity is regulated by anatomical variations along axons. While functional implications in these systems are not always clear, recent studies on the auditory system of birds and mammals present examples of conduction velocity regulation in systems with high temporal precision and a defined biological function. Together these findings suggest an active process that shapes the interaction between axons and myelinating glia to control conduction velocity along axons. Future studies involving these systems may provide further insight into how specific conduction times in the brain are established and maintained in development. Throughout the text, conduction velocity is used for the speed of signal propagation, i.e. the speed at which an action potential travels. Conduction time refers to the time it takes for a specific signal to travel from its origin to its target, i.e. neuronal cell body to axonal terminal. ?? 2013 IBRO.},

abstract = {Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in multiple sclerosis but is poorly understood. We investigated 'physiological' fatigue in 21 patients with multiple sclerosis who complained of disabling fatigue by measuring the decline in strength during a 45 s maximal contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle. The results were compared with those from a control group of 19 healthy subjects. The strength of control subjects declined by approximately 20{\%} during the contraction; twitch interpolation showed central drive remained almost maximal throughout, and therefore that the fatigue was peripheral in origin. Patients had normal baseline strength, but developed greater fatigue (approximately 45{\%}), which was central in origin. In both cases, the decline in strength followed a roughly linear time course suggesting that the patients, like the normals, were trying to maintain a maximum voluntary effort. Evidence for frequency-dependent conduction block (FDCB) in the patients' central motor pathways was sought by measuring the EMG responses to single and paired transcranial magnetic stimuli. Fatigue had no effect on the latency or size of EMG responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting that FDCB was unlikely to have occurred. This was supported by measurements of the maximum speed of voluntary muscle contraction; although the patients showed relatively slow speeds before exercise, the decline in speed after fatigue was no greater than in normal subjects. We conclude that excessive 'physiological' fatigue contributes to the symptom of fatigue in multiple sclerosis and is central in origin. However, since the degree of exercise-induced fatigue did not correlate with the baseline complaint of fatigue, other factors must also be operating to produce the full range of clinical symptoms. We found no conclusive evidence that central fatigue is related to increased dysfunction in the primary central motor pathways and no evidence that FDCB is the pathophysiological mechanism. We postulate that central fatigue in multiple sclerosis is due to impaired drive to the primary motor cortex and several lines of evidence strongly suggest that this is not due to a lack of motivation.},
